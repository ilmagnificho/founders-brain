Navigating B2B sales for the first time can feel slow and overwhelming.

Drawing from his experience founding Monzo and GoCardless, YC's Tom Blomfield shares his playbook for running a tight sales process that lands real, recurring revenue. He walks through each step—free and paid pilots, opt-out contracts, long-term deals—and shows how to prove value and close customers.

At YC, we work with a ton of founders
0:10
who are navigating the B2B sales process
0:13
for the very first time. And I often
0:16
notice some very common and easily
0:18
avoidable mistakes that I want to talk
0:20
about today. So, I'm going to describe
0:22
the typical progression that a B2B
0:24
founder goes through. normally starting
0:26
with something like a a really poorly
0:28
defined and overly long unpaid design
0:32
partnership uh all the way through to
0:35
the like the pro move which is a rapid
0:37
well-defined tightlyun sales process
0:39
that results in contractually recurring
0:41
revenue straight off the bat. In other
0:43
words, I'm going to talk about how to
0:45
close your first B2B contracts. So in
0:48
general, the goal for most early stage
0:51
companies is to progress through this
0:53
sequence as rapidly as possible so that
0:56
you're able to close new ARR every week
0:58
and grow your company. And really 90% of
1:01
the time, the vast vast majority of the
1:03
time, founders get stuck in the very
1:05
early stages. It's the the very long
1:07
unpaid design partnerships. And my job
1:10
is encouraging them to advance to the
1:12
next level as quickly as possible.
1:14
Occasionally though, really only 5% or
1:17
10% of the time, founders will try and
1:19
speedrun the entire process and leap
1:21
right to the end before their product is
1:23
mature enough or without enough social
1:25
proof, i.e. other happy customers who
1:27
will vouch for you. That's pretty rare
1:29
though. Honestly, most founders are too
1:32
slow to progress through these stages.
1:35
So, let's try to lay out the different
1:37
stages and talk through them. The first
1:39
is the design partnership we've talked
1:41
about. Maybe you're very early in your
1:43
company journey. Perhaps you've got some
1:45
Figma mock-ups or really just an idea,
1:48
barely any code written at all. Or
1:50
perhaps you're selling into an industry
1:52
like law or accounting where there's a
1:54
ton of domain knowledge and maybe you
1:56
don't have that knowledge yet. And so
1:58
founders at this stage will often pitch
2:00
uh what's sometimes called a design
2:02
partnership. They'll spend a bunch of
2:04
time with a customer, often a customer
2:07
with a big fancy logo in their office
2:09
observing how they work and kind of
2:12
co-designing this product alongside the
2:14
customer to meet their needs. It sounds
2:17
really good in theory. The issue is that
2:19
these design partnerships are often way
2:22
too long, 3 months, 6 months, and
2:24
they're poorly defined in scope and
2:27
suffer from really low engagement from
2:29
the customer as a result. Since the
2:31
customer isn't paying for your time and
2:34
frankly, they've got their own business
2:35
to run, they just don't spend that much
2:37
time with you co-designing the product.
2:39
The entire engagement is all kind of, I
2:41
don't know, like vague and meandering.
2:44
You've got this fancy logo on your
2:46
website as a design partner, which feels
2:48
like progress to you and you're pretty
2:49
proud of it. And so, you don't want to
2:51
remove it from your website, but really,
2:53
you're not getting any closer to real
2:55
revenue with this customer. It is
2:57
extremely valuable to be able to sit
2:59
next to a customer in their office and
3:00
and observe their work, you know, sit
3:02
next to their keyboard and see what
3:04
they're doing uh for a few days. When
3:07
doing so, I generally suggest founders
3:09
try to identify like narrow pieces of
3:11
work that they can automate. Maybe you
3:14
ask a customer something like, uh,
3:16
what's the part of your job you hate the
3:18
most? Or if you could wave a magic wand,
3:20
what part of your work would you get rid
3:22
of? You can even offer to do the work
3:24
yourself manually for the customer so
3:26
that you really understand what's
3:28
involved. We've seen some of the best
3:30
founders even go undercover and get
3:33
qualified to work as an auditor or a
3:35
real estate agent or an accountant and
3:37
actually go and do the work like get a
3:39
job for a couple of months so they
3:41
deeply understand the problem in the
3:43
domain space. Really, the goal of all of
3:45
this is to identify a really narrow
3:48
burning problem, and you'd be able to go
3:51
away and build a narrow wedge product in
3:53
as little as 48 hours and bring it back
3:55
to the customer and ask them to try it,
3:57
see if it solves their problem. And I'd
3:59
keep iterating over different like
4:01
problem and solution sets until you find
4:04
an initial wedge product that they
4:06
absolutely love. So, if they are happy
4:08
to pay you and use your wed product, I
4:10
then actually wouldn't build more stuff.
4:12
I try and take that wedge product and
4:14
try and sell it to another 10 similar
4:17
customers. What many founders do which
4:19
is a mistake is to try and overbuild a
4:22
really broad platform which is a mistake
4:25
at this stage of your company because
4:26
you just don't have the resources. You
4:28
can waste a lot of time without any real
4:31
signal that the customer wants what
4:33
you're building. And founders often
4:35
justify this as like trying to reach
4:36
feature par with the existing software
4:39
which because you're such a small
4:40
startup is very very difficult. instead
4:42
I just focus on doing one part of that
4:44
um of that solution really really well
4:46
like really focusing on a narrow wedge.
4:48
The problem with building something very
4:50
broad is that rather than telling you
4:53
look this sucks I wouldn't use it the
4:55
design partner instead tries to be
4:58
helpful and maybe they imagine just one
5:01
more feature that they might want that
5:03
might make it valuable and really they
5:05
just don't want to hurt your feelings by
5:06
saying no this sucks. I've also seen
5:09
customers treat founders in a design
5:11
partnership as like an unpaid dev shop.
5:14
The customer gives the founders an
5:15
extremely detailed list of software
5:17
requirements that's only really relevant
5:19
to their business and the list keeps
5:21
growing. The founders understandably
5:24
want to make their first customer
5:25
really, really happy, but they're too
5:27
meek to ask for money. So, they do all
5:29
this bespoke work for free and it ends
5:32
up kind of seeming like an abusive
5:33
relationship. I'm not saying that all
5:35
design partnerships are a waste of time,
5:37
just most of them. Generally speaking,
5:41
more and more features are not the
5:42
answer. Instead, try to pick an initial
5:45
wedge product and sell it aggressively
5:47
for a couple of weeks. And if it doesn't
5:49
work, pick a different wedge. So, bad
5:52
design partnerships is the most common
5:54
problem I see with B2B startups coming
5:56
into YC and and doing sales for the
5:58
first time. Founders cling to these
6:00
long, poorly defined design
6:02
partnerships. they're just going
6:03
nowhere. They get stuck in low bandwidth
6:06
communication with a disengaged partner
6:08
and can't figure out how to move
6:10
forwards. So once founders figure out
6:12
that design partnerships can be a waste
6:14
of time, then they move on to free
6:18
trials, pilots, or proof of concepts.
6:20
These are really all the same kind of
6:22
thing, honestly. Maybe you have an
6:24
initial product built or at least an a
6:26
narrow wedge product that people can
6:28
use, but maybe you don't have the social
6:30
proof from other customers that this
6:32
thing really works yet. And so
6:34
naturally, uh, your early customers want
6:36
to try the thing out before they make a
6:38
financial commitment. These are normally
6:40
called pilots or proof of concepts. One
6:42
founder recently told me that a
6:44
customer, I think they were in France,
6:46
even asked them for a pre-proof concept,
6:49
which seems very low commitment. I I
6:50
really don't know what that is at all.
6:52
The most common problem for these free
6:54
trials is again they're too long, maybe
6:57
two or three months, and they suffer
7:00
from the same low commitment problems as
7:02
a design partnership. There's no target
7:04
or end goal, and the customer isn't
7:06
really committed uh to engaging with the
7:09
product or the design process. So, if
7:11
you're doing a proof of concept, you
7:13
need to understand what are you trying
7:15
to prove? What are the agreed success
7:17
metrics you're aiming for? If you've
7:19
seen my B2B pricing video, I talk about
7:21
defining the value equation with the
7:23
customer. So, for example, that's uh
7:26
what percentage saving or revenue uplift
7:29
are you going to deliver that makes your
7:31
product a good return on investment? For
7:33
example, if you're selling a customer
7:35
service AI, you might claim your product
7:38
might solve 20% of inbound customer
7:40
queries. The customer will be able to
7:43
reduce their customer service team from
7:44
a 100 people to 80 people, saving
7:47
perhaps a million dollars in salaries
7:49
every year. That's the value you claim
7:51
to be delivering. And in return, you
7:54
might charge $200,000 for that software.
7:57
And so, a well-designed pilot or proof
8:00
of concept is an ideal way to prove that
8:03
value. Maybe the customer doesn't really
8:05
believe you can actually solve 20% of
8:07
their queries. So you say give us a
8:09
sample of a thousand queries and let's
8:11
measure how many we can actually solve
8:13
for you. Is it really 20%, or is it 15
8:16
or is it 25% even? Once you've done
8:19
that, your internal champion can now
8:21
take the value equation that you've
8:22
defined with them and this proof that
8:24
you can actually deliver that value to
8:27
their CFO or the CEO and explain why
8:29
it's um a really good investment for
8:32
their firm. If they pay you $200,000,
8:35
they're going to get a million dollars
8:36
of benefit. It's a win-win. So, pilots
8:38
can be a way to convince cautious buyers
8:41
and overcome objections. Uh there are
8:44
different techniques. You might offer
8:45
back testing on historical data or even
8:48
sidebyside uh trials with their existing
8:50
process. So, for example, your customer
8:53
service product will be producing
8:55
answers alongside human agents and you
8:58
can compare the answers at the end. the
9:00
answers that your agent's providing
9:02
isn't really going to go to the
9:04
customers, but they're compared side by
9:05
side for a realistic um evaluation. Or
9:09
you might offer to take on just 1% of
9:11
their total customer service volume,
9:13
which is low risk. Or you could pick a a
9:15
smaller geography that they roll you out
9:17
in before rolling you out across larger
9:19
geographies. Again, this is a chance to
9:22
show that your product works in a lower
9:23
risk environment, so your champion is
9:25
not going to get fired if it all goes
9:26
wrong. But the problem with these free
9:28
pilots often is they still risk
9:30
suffering from low engagement from the
9:32
customers and founders are often very
9:34
afraid to have a willingness to pay
9:36
conversation. They feel like if they
9:39
bring a dollar amount up, it might scare
9:41
the customer off. But honestly, that's
9:43
almost always not true. It's so so
9:45
important to have the the conversation
9:47
with the customer. If I can solve this
9:49
problem for you and deliver these
9:51
metrics we've talked about, how much
9:53
would that be worth to you? you really
9:55
need to disqualify customers who just
9:57
aren't ready, able, or willing to buy
10:00
your product. So, after the free trial,
10:03
founders normally move to paid trials.
10:06
We've talked about design partnerships
10:08
and and free trials that go on forever.
10:10
When founders really get into the groove
10:12
and start ramping up their sales, they
10:14
figure out they need to make these
10:15
pilots much shorter and get a paid
10:18
commitment upfront. Getting a financial
10:21
commitment from the customer is going to
10:22
make them take your pilot much, much
10:24
more seriously. They're now paying for
10:26
your time and hopefully won't want to
10:28
waste their money. As well as the cost
10:30
of the pilot, I'd also ask upfront about
10:33
their willingness to pay for the full
10:35
product. You know, what's the annual fee
10:37
going to be and the price point. It's
10:39
better to know early if they just aren't
10:42
going to pay you any money whatsoever to
10:44
solve this problem. If it helps you
10:45
avoid going through a full procurement
10:47
process or having to talk to finance or
10:49
the CFO, you can ask your champion for
10:51
the amount that they can personally
10:53
approve. Maybe it's a $10,000 or $20,000
10:56
charge on their corporate credit card.
10:58
I'd often take less money if it allows
11:00
you to shortcut a long long approval
11:02
process. You might also ask for other
11:05
kind of commitments from the customer to
11:07
ensure that the pilot is successful
11:09
beyond simply a financial commitment.
11:11
Say you're doing work for an auditor or
11:13
an accountant. Perhaps you should wait
11:16
until there's a live project kicking off
11:18
that's suitable for you to test your
11:20
product on. So you say, "Let's not start
11:22
this month. Let's wait until the first
11:24
of next month because I know you've got
11:25
this important new project with a new
11:27
client. That would be a perfect test
11:28
case for our software." You might insist
11:30
there's client data ready to go or a
11:33
person or even a whole team that's
11:35
dedicated on the client side to testing
11:38
your product. I'd strongly advise you
11:40
also schedule check-ins every couple of
11:42
days with these people. So, if they find
11:44
any bugs or niggles with your software,
11:46
you can fix it overnight and bring it
11:48
back to them, which will really impress
11:49
an enterprise customer. All of that
11:51
might mean you delay the pilot starting
11:54
by a few weeks until there's a suitable
11:55
project. But then from the start date,
11:57
you can insist on a really high
11:59
engagement from the customer. I'd also
12:01
keep the time frame as short as
12:03
possible. really just long enough that
12:05
they can use your software and
12:07
experience the full benefit. Maybe
12:09
that's seven or 14 days if you've got
12:11
the product dialed in uh really well.
12:13
And remember, because your product is so
12:15
early, you're never really selling a
12:17
complete bug-free experience. You're
12:20
actually selling the founders and the
12:21
early team. You're selling the promise
12:24
that you personally are going to solve
12:26
this problem for them. You're promising
12:28
that if anything goes wrong, they have
12:30
your personal cell phone number and
12:31
you're going to respond 24/7 to get the
12:34
problem fixed. I'd track the time to
12:36
first value like a northstar metric,
12:39
reducing it from weeks to hours, is
12:41
often the biggest single lever for
12:43
higher pilot to paid conversion. What
12:45
this actually means is doing janky stuff
12:48
to get your product live as soon as
12:50
possible. For example, I would never do
12:52
a full API integration during a pilot if
12:55
it requires any engineering time from
12:56
the customer whatsoever because that's
12:58
just going to delay you by months. If
13:00
you can work from Excel imports and
13:02
exports, for example, that can work or
13:04
ask the customer to email you the data
13:06
you need and then email back the
13:08
completed work. So, you're really trying
13:09
to get to the point where they can
13:11
experience the value of your product as
13:12
quickly as possible. I'd also insist you
13:14
book a post-pilot meeting before the
13:17
pilot even starts. That's a meeting
13:19
where you can go through the metrics at
13:21
the end of the pilot and show hard ROI
13:24
numbers. It should be really crystal
13:26
clear to the customer at the end of this
13:28
process whether they want to keep using
13:30
your software. Now, this is all pretty
13:32
good, but the downside of a paid pilot
13:35
is you still need to go and negotiate
13:37
the full contract afterwards. It's like
13:40
a whole second sales process just when
13:42
you thought you had a customer who was
13:44
ready to buy. And this can be very, very
13:46
frustrating. So to get around this,
13:48
really sophisticated founders move on
13:51
from paid pilots to recurring revenue
13:53
contracts with an opt- out period. So
13:56
this is typically a monthly or annually
13:58
recurring contract with a 30 or 60-day
14:01
money back guarantee or opt- out period
14:03
at the very start. But by default, if
14:05
the customer does nothing and is happy
14:07
with your product, it's going to turn
14:08
into a full recurring contract after
14:11
that opt- out period with no additional
14:13
sales process needed. That's the pro
14:15
move. It's like magic. It's one sales
14:18
process that turns into a recurring
14:20
revenue contract. And it can be very
14:22
persuasive to be in a sales meeting and
14:24
confidently say, "Well, this is how
14:26
customers buy our product. Typically, we
14:28
offer annual contracts with a 30-day
14:30
grace period or an opt- out and customer
14:33
X, Y, and Z all signed on these terms."
14:36
It can be hard as a an early stage
14:38
founder to leap straight to this step
14:40
when you're just starting out. Maybe
14:42
your sales process isn't good enough.
14:44
Maybe you don't have the social proof or
14:46
maybe simply your product isn't ready
14:48
yet. So starting with an earlier step,
14:50
perhaps a free pilot for the first one
14:53
or two customers and then moving onwards
14:55
can be an option. Of course, you can't
14:58
run before you can walk. But don't be
15:00
stuck crawling on all fours for too long
15:02
either. And for me, that's the overly
15:04
long design partnership with no
15:06
financial commitment. As a side note
15:08
here, be careful what you report to
15:10
investors as MR or ARR, especially if
15:13
customers are still in that opt- out
15:15
period. Just be super clear with
15:16
investors when you're reporting these
15:18
numbers where the customers sit. I think
15:20
the tactic is still absolutely spoton.
15:22
This is just a communication point with
15:24
investors. So, when you've got early
15:26
sales really dialed in, you might be
15:28
closing one of these recurring revenue
15:30
contracts every week or two. After
15:32
you've signed these contracts, that
15:33
takes us to the next thing you should
15:35
focus on, which is customer success. So,
15:38
after you've signed these contracts, you
15:39
may often need to dedicate as much or
15:41
even more effort to actually onboarding
15:44
the customer and making sure they're
15:45
getting value out of your product. I
15:47
spoke to a company just this week that
15:49
had signed $4 million worth of
15:51
contracts, but they implemented less
15:53
than $2 million of those contracts.
15:56
They're simply missing a customer
15:57
success function. Finally, I want to
16:00
finish up with some tips that I've
16:01
learned from YC companies over the last
16:03
years. First, get Sock 2 started as soon
16:07
as possible, as well as any other
16:09
security certifications. It might be
16:11
HIPPA, ISO 27,01.
16:14
These security certifications can delay
16:17
you by months. And so, I'd get it
16:19
started today. There are plenty of YC
16:21
companies that can help you with this,
16:22
from Vant to to newer companies. I'd
16:25
figure out who your internal champion is
16:28
and treat them almost like a co-founder
16:31
inside the company. It's someone who
16:33
sells for you when you're not in the
16:34
room and fights budget battles on your
16:37
behalf. With this person, I'd try and
16:39
set and then work towards a defined
16:41
closing date. They're going to miss it
16:43
almost every time, but it can still help
16:46
create urgency within the customer. Ask
16:48
this person to tell you about their
16:49
sales process upfront. You might say,
16:52
"Describe the last time you bought
16:53
software like this. Who internally had
16:56
to prove it? What was the process?" You
16:58
can map the organization. You might have
17:00
the economic buyer, the technical
17:02
approver, the security gatekeeper, the
17:05
legal team, the day-to-day users, and
17:07
then devise a plan to win over each
17:10
stakeholder explicitly. Once you
17:12
understand that buying process, try to
17:14
drive it forward yourself. Don't leave a
17:17
meeting without the next touch point set
17:19
up. The next tip to move a contract
17:21
along is to get on a plane and
17:23
physically visit your customer in
17:24
person. It can work wonders. You might
17:27
email your your champion and say
17:28
something like, "Hey, I'm going to be in
17:30
Houston next week. What do you say about
17:32
getting lunch?" And if they say yes, you
17:34
book your flight to Houston. Don't get
17:36
caught up in multiple rounds of
17:38
reviewing contracts or NDAs. Customer
17:41
legal teams love to do this back and
17:43
forth. Their entire job is redlining
17:45
contracts, but it's going to slow you
17:47
down incredibly, and it doesn't really
17:48
prevent much risk. So, I'd be pretty
17:50
flexible on signing, frankly, whatever
17:52
your early customers want as long as
17:54
it's not going to expose you to like
17:56
unlimited liability or container clause
17:58
that's going to transfer all the IP in
18:00
your product to your customer or
18:01
something company ending like that. So,
18:03
I' I'd really ask yourself, is this
18:05
clause like company ending or just a
18:07
slight annoyance? And frankly, put up
18:09
with anything that that's not going to
18:10
be company ending. Using scarcity can
18:13
also work. You might say something like,
18:14
"We're talking with seven or eight
18:16
potential customers, but we really only
18:18
have the capacity to work with two
18:20
enterprise customers this quarter. So,
18:22
if you're interested, we'd love to get a
18:24
commitment. Otherwise, let's talk again
18:26
in 6 months." So, this has been a pretty
18:28
exhaustive list. Hopefully, it helps you
18:30
to up your B2B sales game. But if you've
18:32
