How To Start A Dev Tools Company  Startup School

In this episode of Startup School, YC General Partner and Co-Founder of Algolia Nicolas Dessaigne explains the ins and outs of starting a dev tools company from the ground up. He'll explain how to find the right idea, who should be a part of your team, and whether or not you need a sales and marketing team when you're ready to go to market.
---
Intro
0:09
Hello, my name is Nicolas Dessaigne and I'm a group partner here at YC.
0:14
Before that, I was the co founder and CEO of Algolia. Algolia is a search API used by millions
0:21
of developers to build a great search experience in their apps and websites. And it's relevant today because today
0:28
we are going to speak about dev tools and how to start a dev tools company.
0:33
So here's what we're going to cover. First, we'll discuss about the founding team and how to find your idea.
0:40
Then how to start the company from the prototype to the MVP. And finally, we'll dive into the
0:47
go-to market, including sales and marketing for dev tools. But first, what is a dev tool?
0:54
So a dev tool is software that is used by developers to help them build products.
1:00
And that includes a lot of aspects. From coding, testing, debugging,
1:05
documenting, deploying, running. It's all of the gamut of aspects of their job.
1:11
And it's a broad category then. You can think about IDEs, like VS Code. API, like Stripe, Twilio,
1:19
or Algolia, my company. Library and frameworks, like React, Node. js, or LangChain.
1:25
Or even infrastructure or cloud services, like AWS or Vercel. And many other tools.
1:31
Docker, Terraform, Datadog, GitHub. You get it, it's very diverse.
1:37
And at YC, we've supported many of these dev tools. Hundreds of them.
1:42
And we already have two public companies. GitLab, the open source GitHub, and
1:47
PagerDuty, that started as a simple alerting system and now is used
1:52
by half the Fortune 500 companies. And many others. You probably know about Stripe,
1:58
Docker, Heroku, Superbase, Segment, Postdoc, Apollo, Airbyte
2:03
and also Algolia of course. And we've learned a lot from them.
2:08
So let's dive in and start at the founding stage. Well, first you need a founding
2:13
team, and the key aspect of dev tools is that you are going to build
Founding Stage
2:19
a technical product for developers. Obviously, you need to be a developer yourself.
2:24
Most of our co founding team for dev tools are all developer teams.
2:30
And the great thing about dev tools is that developers are actually using dev tools every day.
2:36
So when you're building a dev tool, you're basically helping yourself in your action of building a product.
2:42
So let's take a step back and chat quickly about what are good and bad dev tool ideas.
2:48
And as a preface, let me start by telling you that with the advent of LLMs and AI in general, it's
2:54
actually very difficult to know for sure today what's a good or bad idea. The bad ideas, the tar pit ideas of
3:00
yesterday, could actually be possible to make successful now, thanks to LLMs.
3:06
Some ideas are actually more difficult than others. Developers every day are going to work on things they are actually not going to
3:12
like, like documentation, QA, testing. And these become obvious ideas
3:17
for them to fix for others. The problem here is that they are not the only one to think about it,
3:23
and that creates a lot of noise. And that's why there are so many of these on the market.
3:28
Do you really want to build the next, yet the next QA tool for other developers? Hmm, I don't know.
3:34
Another way to look at it is the difference between build time and runtime ideas.
3:39
So, docs, QA, testing, all of these ideas are build time ideas.
3:45
Things, tools you are going to use when you are building the software. It happens that these ideas
3:50
are mostly nice to have. You could build your product without them.
3:56
What's more interesting are runtime ideas. Why? Because at runtime, it
4:01
becomes really critical. It's must have products. If you bet on an API, for example, you
4:08
cannot run your own product if it's down. That's why it's more critical and it's way better idea for dev tools.
4:16
The other advantage of these runtime ideas is usage because the more your
4:22
customers are going to grow, usually the more they are going to use your product.
4:28
So your incentives are aligned. Think about Stripe, for example. If their customers sell more
4:33
product, they make more money. Everyone is happy. Much better idea. Another quick category that I can
4:40
touch upon is libraries and frameworks. These can be created. It's usually open source.
4:46
But they can also be very challenging to monetize. Think about Pandas, for example.
4:52
Very difficult to make money out of that. The one way you can monetize these ideas is by offering a hosting service.
4:59
Think about Next.js and Vercel, for example. Okay, last point I wanted to touch on
5:05
this idea, which is the LLM and AI trend. Actually, with this change in the
AI Trend
5:11
world, there are many new dev tools being created and it's awesome. It's so exciting to work on a dev tool that's going to help
5:17
these companies building LLMs. But it's also a time where the market is very nascent.
5:23
So an obvious great idea is LLM observability. Well, uh, it's obvious, right?
5:30
Anyone building with LLMs, they want to know how they are doing. They want to be able to evaluate them.
5:35
Guess what? Many other companies think the same thing. And that's why you have dozens, if not hundreds, of such companies out there.
5:42
It doesn't mean that it's a bad idea, but I think that if you are starting in that space, you need
5:48
to have a clear idea of how you are going to differentiate yourself. Or are you going to win against
5:54
all of these competitors? Okay, which leads me to a few mistakes people often do.
5:59
The first one is waiting for the perfect idea. You are going to wait for a very long time.
6:06
Let me go back to these LLM observability ideas. I would actually encourage you, if that's the idea you have, just start.
6:12
That's okay. Even if you don't differentiate yourself right away, that's okay. You learn as you go and eventually
6:19
you'll be able to pull it off or you'll change your idea. Which leads me to my second mistake,
6:24
sticking with the wrong idea for too long. You may not realize, but 50% of
6:31
the companies in YC eventually pivot from their first idea. It's huge.
6:37
And it's also true for dev tools. Finally, last mistake, thinking you need a business founder in the team.
6:44
I know that's what I thought when I created Algolia. We ended up creating Algolia with two tech co founders, but it crossed our mind.
6:49
Hey, we don't know how to sell. We need to hire or to find some other co founder who knows about sales.
6:55
No, it's actually way easier than you think to sell, to learn how to sell your product.
7:01
Actually. We checked the numbers. 74% of YC dev tool companies
7:07
had only tech co founders. And that's compared to 45% for
7:13
all of the other companies. Okay, so now that you have a team and an idea, where do you start?
7:19
Well, there is only two things you have to do. Build and talk with users.
Where to start?
7:24
There is no specific order. You can actually start by talking with users because they are going to help you
7:29
figure out if your initial idea is good. Or you can start by building a prototype so you can get easier feedback from users.
7:36
Let's speak about that prototype. The most important thing here is not to over engineer it.
7:43
You should do that quick and dirty. And I know that it can be very difficult for some developers out
7:49
there, especially for experienced engineers who pride themselves on robustness and scalability of their code.
7:57
But the truth is that the most important thing at that stage is to iterate as fast as you can.
8:03
Rule of thumb, I would assume that you'll throw away 90% of all the code you write.
8:11
So your goal at that stage is just to identify the 10% of what you are building that's actually
8:17
valuable as fast as possible. And then later on, you can refactor this 10% only and avoid wasting a lot of time.
8:25
As you iterate, of course, you'll want to speak with users and get feedback. It's completely okay to show them a prototype.
8:32
Please don't wait to have a perfect product. Just show them a prototype and start gathering feedback as early as you can.
8:39
And that will eventually lead you to an MVP. A minimal viable product.
8:45
And this word, the V is important, viable. You need to provide value to your customers.
8:51
It's much better to be 10x better on a very tiny thing for someone who cares about it.
8:59
Working for a niche is completely okay. Once you have real customers who love your product, it will be
9:04
very easy to expand from there. Let me give you the example of Algolia. Well, today Algolia is a
9:09
very broad, large, like full featured search engine, right?
9:15
But when we started, to be honest, it was just a glorified autocomplete, very minimal.
9:20
But that product was so much better than whatever else was available at the time
9:26
that some people cared enough about it. And when we, when we started demonstrating
9:31
it, we didn't have much to show. Actually, I still remember our first customer, that first
9:36
meeting, when I did demo using a command line to indexed content.
9:42
We didn't have any API client yet. We didn't have any admin UI yet, just a command line and then a very
9:48
simple webpage to show the search. That was enough to close a $2,000 a month contract.
9:54
Okay, you have built something you can show users. So the next step is to talk with users.
9:59
I know that many developers, many tech co founders are actually introverts and they don't like speaking with users or with customers.
Talking to users
10:06
Like, they don't like sales. Well, you may not realize, but as you are building a dev tool,
10:12
you have a huge advantage. You know your audience. You are the audience, you are a
10:18
developer yourself, you speak the language of your customers, you are uniquely qualified to understand them.
10:24
So, you'll see, it actually will be way easier than you think. Please don't wait for the product to be ready.
10:31
You want to learn ASAP right away if you are solving a real problem that people will be ready to pay for.
10:38
But how do you find these users? Two things, outreach and launches.
10:43
Let's speak about outreach quickly. Dev tool co founders often plan to have a bottom up adoption model where
10:50
individual developers are going to come inbound, try the product, and convert. Or maybe become their
10:55
champions at bigger companies. Well, I have some bad news for you.
11:01
Nobody knows you yet. So to get there, first, you need to get people to know about you.
11:08
And there is no other way to do that than outreaching and finding them yourself. But you need to be smart about it.
11:14
Start with your network, your previous colleagues or classmates. And then you expand from there, um,
11:20
friends of friends, you can leverage LinkedIn, you can find like specific calls over there, but please,
11:26
please personalize your messages. Like, don't copy what you can see out there, sent by marketers.
11:34
Actually, you're developers, I'm sure you hate these messages. So don't do the same. Just ask yourself, would you be
11:41
excited to open your message? Then ask your co founder, ask other developer friends, would they be excited
11:47
to open your message, and then read your email, and then possibly act on it? Well, you simply iterate until they do.
11:54
Now, let's speak about launching. You can launch many times. And that's what you should do
Launches
12:00
here to get more attention. The best place to launch for dev
12:06
tools, I would argue, is Hacker News. Hacker News is a community of
12:11
intellectually curious people. Many of them are developers. And there is that section in
12:18
Hacker News called Show HN. That's the perfect place to launch and gather feedback on what you are building.
12:25
Again, like when you were writing like kind of this outreach messages. Please don't do marketing,
12:31
don't try to sell your product. Just explain plainly and simply what's new
12:37
and interesting in what you are building. That will be very engaging for the community and they'll share comments to you.
12:44
Engage with these comments. Don't let them unanswered. Try to engage with people asking questions.
12:50
Some of them are going to be haters and be rude. Well, you should engage with them too, but your goal is not to convince
12:56
them, it's just to convince any other readers who are going to read how you reply to these haters.
13:02
Just be classy here. One of the great examples here is Segment. They simply did an experiment by
13:09
launching their next idea on Hacker News. And it blew up. They got hundreds of votes
13:15
and so many comments that they knew they were onto something. And that became their idea.
13:20
Another example is Ollama. Ollama helps companies run LLMs on their own machines.
13:26
Well, it started as a comment on a comment on another post on Hacker News.
13:31
And just from that, they got a few people interested. And then shortly after,
13:38
they launched their product. It completely took off on Hacker News. They got like, again, hundreds of upvotes.
13:43
And they knew they were onto something. And they didn't stop there. They launched again and again every few months.
13:50
Each time they had like new things to share. And that continued to fuel their growth, creating a lot
13:56
of excitement in the community. Hacker News, best place to launch. The last thing I wanted to touch
14:02
upon here in that section is you should do things that don't scale.
14:07
So again, you're here to learn as fast as possible from your users, what they like or not about your product.
14:15
A great example of a team that did things that don't scale is Stripe. Early on, the Stripe team were going to
14:22
their customers, small startups, and they helped them implement their own product.
14:27
Sitting side by side in front of the computer, coding with them. That was not only a great way to make sure
14:34
their users were going to be satisfied, were going to be actually excited about what they were building, but it was
14:40
also a great way to gather invaluable feedback very early from their users.
14:46
So it's completely okay to do things that don't scale if they lead to faster learnings.
14:52
Okay, and here are a few mistakes to avoid. So you remember, the goal is to go fast and iterate fast.
14:58
So please don't choose a tech stack because it's cool, because you want to learn it. No, you should took it because of
15:05
your expertise with it so that you can iterate as fast as possible. Other mistakes we, we touch,
15:11
not talking with users. Please get that feedback as fast as
15:16
you can, which also means avoiding overbuilding before getting that feedback.
15:22
Maybe a small thing here. Be careful about that feedback. Be careful about not misunderstanding
15:27
some of the developer feedback. For example, they may share, they may tell you, Oh, you should build your product.
15:34
You don't care. You just want to know if they would use your product or not and why. Or they could tell you,
15:40
Hey, you know what? I could build this in a week. I don't need it. Well, guess what? You just build it yourself in a week.
15:46
You're fine. You should not mind about that. Just move on and continue improving the product. Last mistake some teams
15:53
do is hiring too early. Very early on you don't even know if your product is providing value.
16:00
Please don't hire anyone until you have convinced yourself you are working on the right idea.
16:06
Let's now talk about go to market. And the first question you should ask yourself about go to
16:12
market is your business model. More explicitly, should you be open source?
GTM
16:18
Open source has become one of the main go to market for dev tools, and it definitely works as a business model,
16:24
as many companies have proven, like Databricks, Elastic, HashiCorp, GitLab. All awesome great companies.
16:30
I would argue that you must be open source if you are working on things like a library or framework.
16:36
That's what's today expected for the market. Developers wouldn't implement on top of a new framework that is not open source.
16:43
You should also be open source if you are dealing with data, especially sensitive data. A new database would need to be open
16:50
source or an API connecting with sensitive data in a CRM or maybe
16:56
an EHR needs to be open source. You could be open source but probably don't have to be open source if you are
17:02
working on other things like an API or maybe an application like a bug tracker. Maybe in that case it's not as important
17:09
but still could be your differentiation. Open source has quite a lot of benefits.
17:15
Your customers are developers. Well, as you know already, developers prefer working with open source tools.
17:22
It's also going to help you create more awareness through the community. It can be also your differentiation, like
17:28
you could be the open source version of X. Think about PostHog and Amplitude,
17:34
or Supabase and Firebase, or Airbyte and Fivetran. Great approach. Speaking of Airbyte, you could also
17:40
receive contributions from the community. In the case of Airbyte, they got a lot of connectors contributed from the community.
17:46
But I would be careful on that one. Most cases, you shouldn't count on them, because the quality of the contribution
17:52
may not be up to your standards. And then you have to deal with the contributors.
17:58
And that could be more actually more difficult than you think. But in most cases, I would say that you should not count on them.
18:06
Good contributions are actually pretty rare. And last benefit, but not the least, is the trust.
18:11
And it's actually very important for large enterprises in the enterprise realm.
18:18
Take the example of Medplum, for example, who is building a open source EHR.
18:23
The fact that they are open source, I would argue, probably help them shorten their sales cycle with
18:28
enterprises by a year or more. There is one thing you need to think about, however, when you are
18:34
creating an open source project. Maybe not at the start, but pretty soon. It's monetization.
18:41
If you cannot monetize your product, you don't have a company. At some point, even if it's
Monetization
18:46
later in the life of the company, you need to earn money. There are many variants out
18:52
there, but it's good to look at the common approaches. Some of the common ones are hosting, having a cloud offer.
18:58
So your customers may use your open source free, self hosted, but they
19:04
could also pay for you to host it so that they don't have to maintain it. Sometimes cloud version also
19:10
have like some additional features like team management. Another one is being open core.
19:15
In that case, you usually have a special offer, typically an enterprise offer, that have advanced features that are
19:22
not in the open source version, or maybe they're on a different license. Common features are typically
19:27
the ones that are going to be necessary for enterprises, like SSO, audit logs, disaster recovery,
19:34
SLAs, these kind of features. And finally, some open source companies
19:39
charge for support and services. But I would actually discourage you to follow that monetization path,
19:45
because your incentive becomes to build the most complex product possible, so you can charge for support and
19:51
services, which is a bad incentive. And if your product doesn't need too much support, then people are going to churn
19:57
and not renew their support contract. And what if you are not open source? Well, for these dev tools, they are
20:03
usually following one of two approaches. Either they are usage based, like APIs, Algolia, Twilio, Stripe.
20:10
And so they charge based on the usage their customers do. Possibly they have a volume discount.
20:17
Or enterprise specific options that are on the side. And the second approach is
20:23
having some specific plans. Typically like a good, better, best approach. Good is going to be the self serve option.
20:31
Um, that's going to solve the problem of developers for a very low price. For the better options, usually
20:36
are going to be interacting with engineering managers, who are going to care about collaboration. That's going to enable teams,
20:43
still can be self serve. And the best option is higher up. You are talking to the CTO.
20:49
It's all about security, audit logs, disaster recovery, SLA.
20:54
And in that case, it's usually a sales led approach. Let's speak about sales. So, as a quick reminder from what I was
21:01
saying earlier, don't fear outreach. Even if most dev tools are going to end up being bottom up and rely on inbound
Selling
21:10
only heavily, no one knows you at first, and so you need to start with outreach. That period of founder
21:16
outreach is how you start. As you get more well known, that's when you'll get inbound.
21:23
Usually you're going to have at that point more self serve leads. And then eventually, you will end
21:28
up hiring a sales team to sell to bigger accounts, enterprise. So, should you hire a sales team?
21:35
Well, I would argue that you should wait as long as you can. Start by selling yourself.
21:41
Don't delegate away. The truth is that you are the only person in the company today
21:47
capable of selling your own product. If you as the founder cannot sell your product, nobody else can.
21:55
As a rule of thumb, I would wait to get to about $1 million ARR before hiring your first salesperson.
22:03
And even then, try to hire people who are technical, who at least understand
22:08
developers, because developers hate speaking with salespeople. I actually remember our first
22:14
sales people at Algolia. They decided to change their title on LinkedIn. And instead of like being sales,
22:20
well, account execs, they called themselves product specialists. And the nice thing here is that they
22:27
actually had to own that stages. They had to understand the product intimately. So it was kind of like a great
22:32
incentive for them to be better at product and a great way for them to open doors with developers who,
22:39
um, don't want to speak with sales. Another example, PostHog. Did you know that Tim their
22:44
CTO is also their sales leader? Not a business leader. Their sales leader is also the CTO.
22:51
He sees sales as an engineering problem, which is an awesome approach for a dev tool. If you want to learn more about
22:57
sales, you should also watch Pete's talk about enterprise sales, another startup school video.
23:03
So is it different to sell a dev tool from selling any other product? Yes, it is.
23:08
You shouldn't build a sales deck. Developers don't want to waste their time reading through a sales deck.
23:16
You should show, not tell. Just do demonstrations. I think that's the best sales
23:23
approach you can do for a dev tool. At Algolia, we didn't have a sales deck before we got to $10 million ARR.
23:31
So even our sales like proper account execs were just showing demonstrations
23:37
when they were selling and that was working so much better for everyone. You should lean completely in
23:43
the tech aspect of your product. For example, at Algolia, we sell a lot to e commerce players.
23:48
And what we realized is that when the buyer is not technical, and want a turnkey
23:55
solution, we always, not always, but most of the time, we actually lose the deal.
24:00
But when the buyer is technical, or if tech has a lot of influence in
24:05
the decision, we win way more often. So we realized by leaning into that aspect of our product.
24:12
We are an API. We are not like a turnkey solution. Well, we ended up like finding our
24:18
ICP and having better success selling. Okay. And the last thing that is also true in within dev tools is
24:24
that most of them are bottom up. What that means is that a lot of people are going to self serve even within enterprises.
24:32
So instead of going top down, just pitching your product directly, sales
24:38
should also check if some of the enterprise employees are already using the product, and they should then
24:45
focus on helping management understand what the product is already doing for them and how much more it could help
24:52
them if they were to pay for more. Like new seats or features or actual usage.
24:58
Okay, so the last topic I wanted to touch in this video is developer marketing.
25:06
Your goal is to create a lot of awareness for your product because you want inbound. The first thing you should
Marketing
25:11
do is find your community. So it could be Hacker News or some subreddit or some discords out there that
25:19
is related to what you're working on. But be careful. Your goal is not to sell
25:24
your product just yet here. Just be helpful. Just establish yourself as the expert.
25:31
And of course people are going to start knowing you and trust your brand, your company.
25:36
That will help you down the line. People will think about you when they have that problem. Launch often.
25:43
That's very important. We discussed about, uh, the example of Ollama before. But that should also be done
25:49
for the life of your company. Some companies even do launch weeks and have been very successful for that.
25:55
It works great for open source, for example. Supabase is doing that once a quarter,
26:01
bundling all their news in one week a quarter to make as much noise as they can. Other things you can do.
26:08
Make your documentation a first class citizen. Documentation is often an
26:13
afterthought for developers. They prefer coding than actually documenting their code.
26:19
I would argue that documentation should never be an afterthought. It should be part of the product.
26:24
Documentation is marketing. That's how people are going to interact with your product.
26:30
That's actually the first place people are going after your homepage and maybe a pricing page.
26:35
Stripe and other dev tools have really raised expectations there.
26:40
Developers have become very demanding. That's something you should invest in.
26:45
At Algolia, we decided that a feature was not ever done until the doc was done.
26:51
And documentation should be written by developers. You know Algolia, even when we call the team.
26:57
And at some point, uh, we created that documentation team. Their role was not to write the documentation for the developers.
27:04
They were here to help developers write better documentations. For example, they built a tool where
27:09
it would automatically insert API keys for people who'd be logged in so that when they copy paste the code,
27:16
it would work right away out of the box which made the documentation ever more useful for our customers.
27:22
Speaking of things that developers should do, I would include support there. You should make support a
27:29
huge part of your marketing. Your users are developers, right?
27:34
Developers hate speaking to these level one support people who don't know anything
Support
27:40
about the product they are supporting. Engineers should do support, and that's going to lead to two great things.
27:47
One, your users are developers, and when they interact with developers who speak their language, they're
27:53
going to be way more satisfied. Actually, I have examples where someone would reach out to support, and then
27:58
the developers, like the person doing the support, was able to actually fix the bug and deploy in 20 minutes.
28:06
And so that kind of like blew the customer away. Like they were so impressed, so excited about the product.
28:11
And two, it's going to help your own developers much better
28:16
understand your customers needs. Because they are going to face the pain as they are supporting them.
28:23
And that's a great way for them to be the better product. Taking the example of Algolia again, we actually waited until
28:30
hundreds of employees before we built a delegated support team. And then we actually asked our best
28:37
engineering manager to build that team. Support was never a second class citizen for us.
28:43
So, developers are doing documentation, developers are doing support, all of that is your marketing.
28:49
Should you ever hire a marketing team or when should you do that? Well, similarly to sales, I think
28:56
founders should lead marketing for a long time, maybe forever actually. To be honest, even at a later stage,
29:02
I don't know a single dev tool company that is happy with their CMO when they
29:08
have a traditional marketing background. Why? Because traditional marketers, they
29:13
don't really understand the persona. They don't really understand developers. Only other developers do.
29:19
And developers really hate being marketed at. Please don't insult their intelligence.
29:24
You know that because you are developers, right? Well, early on at Algolia, we were
29:29
actually asking every single engineer in the team to do what we called a marketing hack every single month.
29:37
A hack could be writing a simple blog post, or could be speaking at a meetup,
29:42
or could be building a new search. All our best marketing at
29:47
Algolia was done by developers. I would encourage you as you build your marketing team to make sure that you have
29:54
a lot of developers in your marketing team, because they are the ones who know how to speak to your customers.
30:00
You may ask, what about dev advocates? Well, I love the idea because that means having developers in your marketing team.
30:07
But it's also a very ill defined role with often a lot of very fuzzy expectations.
30:14
So it's difficult to measure. It's difficult to build accountability for.
30:19
So my recommendation here would be to wait and first leverage your existing engineering team.
30:26
and ask them to do some form of marketing or dev advocacy. And probably at Series A or
30:33
later, it starts to make sense to hire dedicated dev advocates. Even then, think about hiring from
30:38
within, or from your community. For example, if your open source could be contributors or active or helpful
30:46
Discord members, these are the best dev advocate candidates to join you.
30:51
So let's wrap up and recap what we said here. Start now. Please don't wait for the perfect
30:57
idea because as you are going to build your product, even if it's not a perfect idea, you'll do the reps.
Outro
31:02
You'll learn. And that will lead you to the best idea. If you don't start,
31:08
you'll never get anywhere. Build quickly. Please, please, don't over engineer.
31:13
You need to have that very fast iteration pace where you can learn from your users as you are building.
31:20
Crappy, quick and dirty is completely okay early stage, and then you refactor what actually matters.
31:27
Spend time with your users. Like, there is no way you're going to learn if you don't speak with your users.
31:32
Learn from them. Do things that don't scale. Go to their office. Spend time with them. Launch early.
31:38
You may have seen many of our videos where we say, there is no shame in launching early. People won't remember you
31:43
if it doesn't work out. But you could get invaluable feedback that will lead you to work on the
31:49
right product to build the right thing that people need. As you are building a dev tool, you should
31:56
consider open source as your go to market. Observe the market, observe other players, how they have built their
32:02
product, and figure out if open source is the right thing for you. But don't dismiss it. Think about it hard
32:08
before making a choice. Don't forget, you are the best salesperson for your product.
32:13
No one else is going to know your product or your audience as well as you do.
32:19
Learning to sell is way easier than learning how to speak with a developer. And finally, you are also the best
32:26
marketing person for your product. You know the language of developers, you know how to speak with them,
32:32
you know where they are spending their time, the community, you know how to access this audience
32:38
Okay, that's wrapped up for me today. Thanks for watching the video. And if you are building a dev tool,
32:44
don't forget you can apply to YC anytime.
