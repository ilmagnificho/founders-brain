How To Find A Co-Founder  Startup School

Building a startup and trying to break into an established market is very difficult, especially if you’re trying to do it alone! That’s why it’s critical to find the right co-founder for the journey. In this episode of Startup School, YC Group Partner Harj Taggar explains why you need a co-founder, when to bring them on, where you can find one and how to maintain the relationship.

0:09
hey everyone I'm Harge tagger I'm one of
0:11
the group Partners here at y Comin and
0:13
today I'm going to talk about
0:14
co-founders uh we're going to cover why
0:18
do you even need a co-founder um when's
0:20
the right time to bring on a co-founder
0:23
and where can you find them let's start
0:25
with talking about why should you have a
0:26
co-founder at all I think there are
0:28
three reasons the first building a
0:31
successful startup is an incredibly hard
0:33
thing to do and there is a huge amount
0:35
of work to be done right like you're
0:37
trying to take your idea make it a
0:39
reality and compete with companies that
0:42
have hundreds of employees and have been
0:43
around for many many years and you
0:47
really can't do that alone like you need
0:49
someone else there who at a basic level
0:53
can just get more work done with you
0:55
right two people is more working hours
0:57
per day than one but also having a good
1:00
co-founder improves the quality of your
1:02
work so if you have a co-founder with
1:04
complimentary skill sets they can do
1:06
things that you can't right if you have
1:08
a co-founder um who's smart they can
1:11
challenge your ideas they can talk you
1:13
out of bad ones and help you find good
1:15
ones that's why it's really important to
1:17
have a a co-founder just so that you can
1:20
get good high quality work done at the
1:23
rate you need to be successful the
1:24
second reason startups are a real
1:26
emotional roller coaster you have
1:28
moments where you think you're going to
1:29
take over the world and moments where
1:31
you're convinced you're about to die and
1:33
having a great co-founding relationship
1:35
can be a huge source of support in a way
1:38
that no one else can right because your
1:41
co-founder ideally should be someone
1:43
who's all in on the startup in the same
1:45
way that you are and when you're having
1:46
bad moments they can bring you up and
1:48
you can do the same for them and that's
1:50
an important reason why you can't just
1:52
of hire people or have people join your
1:54
startup once it's already successful to
1:56
get the the true benefits of co-founders
2:00
you need someone who's all in and
2:01
invested in the same way you are and the
2:03
final reason is simply patent matching
2:06
if you look at the most successful
2:07
startups in history they all had
2:09
co-founding teams and we don't always
2:12
realize this because once a startup
2:13
becomes successful it's common for some
2:16
Founders to leave and one founder
2:18
especially the CEO to become well-known
2:21
uh famous and associate with the startup
2:23
right if we go through some examples
2:26
Facebook one of the biggest companies in
2:27
the world is really now known as Mark
2:29
Zuckerberg's company but he actually
2:31
co-founded it with Dustin moskovitz if
2:33
you think of Apple it's of course known
2:35
as Steve Jobs company and very rightly
2:37
so but Steve Jobs literally couldn't
2:40
have built the first Apple computer if
2:42
he didn't have Steve wnc as his
2:44
co-founder so hopefully I've convinced
2:45
you that you really want a co-founder to
2:47
improve your odds of success if you want
2:49
to start a startup but let's say you
2:53
feel ready to go now uh and you really
Should you start a company without a co-founder?
2:55
want to start the company but you don't
2:57
have a great co-founder in mind yet
2:59
should you start the company anyway or
3:01
should you wait until you have a
3:02
co-founder I think again in 90% of the
3:05
cases you should really spend all of
3:07
your efforts and trying to find a great
3:08
co-founder to start a company with but I
3:11
do think in 10% of the cases there's
3:13
some exceptions I think the biggest
3:14
exception is if you meet two conditions
3:17
one you have a very specific idea you
3:19
want to work on that you're very
3:21
passionate about and you have some
3:23
domain experience that makes you really
3:26
uniquely qualified to work on that idea
3:28
set another way if you have an idea that
3:31
you have really high conviction about
3:33
that solving a real problem because
3:35
you've got some experience that makes
3:38
you an expert on the problem and you're
3:42
an engineer and you can start building
3:43
it you can make progress without
3:45
requiring a technal co-founder then I
3:48
think it's fair for you to get going
3:50
start the company build the first
3:51
version of the product and bring a
3:54
co-founder on as you start making some
3:56
progress and traction if you're not an
3:58
engineer I don't think you can do this
4:00
and I think you should really focus your
4:01
time on trying to find a great technical
4:04
co-founder um to start the company with
4:07
okay so let me give you an example of
4:09
when YC combinator funded a single
4:11
founder that worked out really well it
4:12
was Drew hon the founder of Dropbox so
4:15
Drew applied to YC as a single founder
4:18
and he was actually initially rejected
4:19
and told to go get a co-founder so he
4:23
did bring on a co-founder a great
4:24
co-founder a rash but Drew kept making
4:27
progress on Dropbox anyway he would both
4:29
both build the product again make
4:32
progress on the MVP while also looking
4:34
in the background for a co-founder and
4:36
he found a great one so let's talk about
4:38
what should you look for in a potential
What should you look for in a potential co-founder?
4:40
co-founder I'm going to start by giving
4:41
you a bit of meta advice here the thing
4:43
that's most important about your
4:46
co-founder is that they can handle
4:48
stress well because there's going to be
4:50
lots of stress as you start and work on
4:52
your startup journey and even if they
4:54
have the perfect set of complimentary
4:56
skills if they don't handle stress well
4:59
or don't help each other handle stress
5:01
well it's very unlikely your
5:03
relationship is going to last the stress
5:05
and rigors of founding a company and
5:08
this is why failed co-founder
5:09
relationships is really the number one
5:11
reason we see startups fail here at wcom
5:15
so how do you know if someone can handle
5:16
stress well or not well the best way is
5:19
to have worked with them under stress
5:21
previously right counterintuitively this
5:24
is one reason why often starting a
5:26
company with a friend or a former work
5:30
isn't always guaranteed to work out
5:32
because maybe you never worked under
5:35
real stress with your former colleague
5:36
because you were both working at Google
5:38
or a big company where there just wasn't
5:40
like the same amount of stress as you
5:42
have under under startup conditions or
5:44
maybe you and your friends really enjoy
5:46
hanging out socially and you have a
5:48
great time together but you've never
5:49
been in any intense stressful situations
5:51
so if you've not been in a stressful
5:53
situation with someone before you can
5:54
never know for sure how they'll handle
5:57
stress which means no co-founder
5:59
relation relationship is a Surefire bet
6:02
but you are definitely more likely um to
6:05
survive and do well with someone you've
6:07
already worked with and that you already
6:08
know in some capacity than a total
6:10
stranger the second thing when you're
6:12
looking for a co-founder is make sure
6:15
that they have the same high level goals
6:17
in starting a company as you do right
6:20
people have different motivations for
6:22
wanting to start startups and the type
6:25
of startup they want to start so let me
6:27
give you an example if you really want
6:30
to found a high press fast growing
6:34
startup that raises multiple rounds of
6:36
funding and can one day go public then
6:40
you will not be a good co-founder fit
6:42
for somebody who wants to grow slow and
6:44
steady and build a lifestyle business
6:46
that makes good amounts of Revenue and
6:49
pays good salaries but doesn't come with
6:51
a ton of pressure and expectations right
6:53
that's just one example but there's all
6:55
kinds of other ways we see co-founders
6:58
who are indiv ually very skilled and
7:01
have great complimentary skill sets
7:03
still not work out which is they just
7:05
had different reasons for starting a
7:07
company and that eventually causes
7:09
enough friction to really fracture that
7:12
relationship so my advice would be
7:14
before you start a company with someone
7:16
talk about this stuff like ask them why
7:18
they want to start a company ask them
7:20
what success looks like for them um and
7:23
try and get a good read on are you both
7:24
aligned on why you're starting this
7:26
company and what you want out of it my
7:28
final advice would be don't overly focus
7:31
on the specific set of skills your
7:33
co-founder has today of course ideally
7:36
you want a co-founder that has
7:37
complimentary skills in particular if
7:40
you're building a software or technology
7:42
company there really should be at least
7:44
one co-founder who's Technical and can
7:46
program but let's say you have that
7:49
don't overly fixate on which specific
7:51
technical skills does that co-founder
7:53
have it doesn't matter if they can only
7:55
program in a certain language or if
7:56
they've only got experience building
7:58
iPhone app applications versus web
8:01
applications Again The Meta skill you
8:03
care about is is your co-founder smart
8:06
and are they willing to learn new things
8:07
and willing to adapt as your startup
8:09
grows and changes um which means you
8:12
care a lot more about their trajectory
8:14
like how can they grow as your startup
8:16
grows and can they acquire the skills
8:18
they'll need more so than do they have a
8:21
specific set of skills today so next
8:24
let's talk about where can you find
8:26
co-founders again my meta advice is you
8:29
should ideally have a set of potential
Where can you find co-founders?
8:32
co-founders long before you actually
8:35
plan on starting a startup and the way
8:37
you do that is in the course of your
8:40
life like when you're studying or when
8:42
you're working is to kind of always be
8:44
trying to find people to work on
8:45
projects with together because working
8:48
on projects whether they're weekend
8:49
projects side projects just stuff purely
8:51
for fun gives you a chance to get to
8:53
know what someone's really like to work
8:55
with are they motivated do they like are
8:57
they good at the things that they say
8:58
they're good at in an environment that's
9:00
a little bit less pressurized than a
9:01
startup right um I think one of maybe
9:04
the edgiest pieces of advice I've heard
9:06
on
9:06
this uh at a Yom talk was from a Founder
9:10
who said that in the sort of decade
9:12
before they started their company they
9:14
really used to think a lot about who are
9:16
their friends who are the people they
9:17
were closest to and spending the most
9:18
time with and how many of those people
9:21
would they start a company with Someday
9:23
I'm not saying this is a right advice
9:25
for everybody but just to give you one
9:28
uh extreme end of the Spectrum it would
9:30
be to like always be scanning for people
9:32
you might start a company with someday
9:34
and making sure you're spending time
9:35
with them now let's say you want to
9:37
start a company now like you you are
9:38
ready um how do you do that where do you
9:41
find potential co-founders again the
9:43
advice is obvious it's people you
9:45
already know but the number one blocker
9:47
I see to why people say they're having a
9:50
hard time finding a co-founder is that
9:52
they already assume that everybody they
9:55
know is not available like a common
9:57
excuse I hear is oh yeah like I know
9:59
know lots of people who would be a great
10:01
potential co-founder but they're not
10:03
ready to start a startup right now or
10:05
they just got a job at Google or
10:07
Facebook and they will never leave and
10:10
my number one bit of advice to them is
10:12
you can never make any assumptions about
10:14
who's available you have to always make
10:16
the ask and you have to get in the habit
10:18
of asking people hey like I want to
10:21
start a company would you join me I
10:23
think you'd make a great co-founder I
10:24
think we'd make a great co-founding team
10:26
here's one uh tactic I also give people
10:30
which is once you made the ask if that
10:32
person really says that they're not
10:34
available is ask them who would they
10:36
pick to be their co-founder if they were
10:38
starting a company and ask for an
10:40
introduction to that person right so go
10:43
and meet that person and get to know
10:44
them but this sort of like branching out
10:46
of your network is a good algorithm for
10:48
finding more potential co-founders who
10:51
aren't in your immediate Network another
10:53
way to find more co-founders if you need
10:55
to grow your surface area um is to just
10:58
start doing things like in particular uh
11:02
if you're a technical or if you're an
11:03
engineer work on some open source
11:05
projects attend hackathons attend
11:08
developer meetups in your area those are
11:10
great sources of finding other people
11:12
who like doing and Building Things who
11:15
might be open to quitting their job or
11:18
dropping out of grad school to work on a
11:20
startup with you another specific place
11:21
to find potential co-founders is the YC
11:24
co-founder matching platform so we've
11:26
made it easy for people who are trying
11:28
to find co-founders to upload their
11:30
profiles and find other people that
11:32
might want to start a company with them
11:34
now I'm me give you my honest take we
11:36
started the YC co-founder matching
11:38
platform because we want to increase the
11:40
number of startups that exist in the
11:42
world and part of that is helping more
11:44
people find great co-founders but there
11:47
is a particular formula that works well
11:50
for finding somebody on a co-founder
11:52
matching platform even why combinators
11:55
and that is to try and find people who
11:57
you have things in common with who are
11:59
the kinds of people that there's a good
12:02
chance you would have ended up meeting
12:04
at some point anyway okay so let me give
12:06
you some of a couple of examples to give
12:09
you a sense of what I I really mean by
12:11
that a good example of teams we see from
12:15
the YC co-founder matching platform are
12:18
teams that we could describe as two
12:20
co-founders who would probably have
12:22
eventually met each other anyway it just
12:25
happened to be on the co-founder
12:26
matching platform and that's teams where
12:29
you know it's people who both studied
12:30
computer science um roughly the same age
12:34
like they work on projects and seem to
12:36
have like similar flavors to them their
12:38
interests overlap like that's the kind
12:40
of team we feel like ah like that's
12:42
probably the kind of team that would
12:43
have eventually found each other anyway
12:45
the kinds of teams we don't get so
12:48
excited about are where the co-founders
12:50
would never have met each other in sort
12:52
of any conceivable Universe it's where
12:55
there's a huge age difference or they
12:56
don't have any sort of mutual interest
12:58
or they just doesn't seem like those are
13:00
the types of Founders that would have
13:02
anything in common if they hadn't found
13:04
each other on a co-founder matching
13:06
platform so once you found a potential
13:08
co-founder how do you go about getting
13:10
started working together well if you
13:13
already know each other well you're
13:14
already friends former colleagues then I
How do you get started working together?
13:16
think you just get going like you decide
13:19
what to work on um you start building a
13:21
prototype you can apply to Y comor
13:23
there's lots of great advice out there
13:25
for how do you get a startup going once
13:27
you have your co-founder if you don't
13:28
know know your co-founder very well
13:31
already which again is not optimal um
13:34
but my advice would be to just test it
13:35
out for a bit like can you spend some
13:38
evenings and weekends working together
13:40
and trying out small projects like
13:42
really this is not that different from
13:44
deciding who to marry you want to have
13:45
like a little bit of a daing period
13:47
where you kind of just get to know each
13:48
other and have conversations of the type
13:51
I mentioned before about you know why do
13:53
you want to start a company what are
13:55
your goals from this um and have a
13:57
period of trying that out before you
14:00
really Jump and Go Allin uh on being
14:02
co-founders okay so once you've decided
14:04
to go Allin and start a company with
14:06
somebody you'll go through some
14:07
logistical steps like you're
14:08
incorporating the company and you
14:09
initial each other shares you will have
14:12
to decide on what the equity split will
14:14
be and my default advice here would be
14:19
you should split the equity equally
14:21
between yourselves and the reason is if
14:23
this startup is successful you will end
14:25
up working on it for the next 10 years
14:27
or more and so even if someone's been
14:30
thinking about the idea for a little bit
14:31
longer now or done a little bit more
14:33
work that will really be quite
14:35
insignificant over the long term of the
14:38
startups life and so it's better that
14:41
you both start from a equal co-founding
14:44
Equity split so you're both equally
14:46
invested and you both feel like you have
14:48
real equal ownership over the company
14:50
and want to give it your role so while
14:52
everyone does their best to make sure
14:53
their co-founding relationship works
14:56
unfortunately they don't always and as I
14:58
mentioned before for the number one
15:00
reason startups fail at y com is the
15:03
co-founders break up so what are some of
15:05
the most common reasons for that
15:06
happening I would say like the number
15:09
one core reason is the co-founders
Common reasons for co-founder breakups
15:11
didn't respect each other or they grew
15:13
to not respect each other and
15:15
specifically what I've seen is it's very
15:18
common for co-founders to have different
15:20
roles and responsibilities a common
15:22
split is one co-founder is responsible
15:23
for sales and getting customers and the
15:26
other co-founder is responsible for
15:27
product and building the technology and
15:29
that's a very clear uh delineation of
15:32
responsibilities which is great but
15:34
problems will creep in if the sales
15:37
co-founder feels that the technical
15:38
co-founder is not building the product
15:40
quickly or well enough and or the
15:43
technical co-founder feels the sales
15:45
co-founder is not selling the product
15:47
well enough if that respect breaks down
15:50
and one co-founder feels they could do
15:51
the other co-founder's job better than
15:53
them uh it's very hard to recover from
15:55
that and that's usually the single most
15:58
common reason we see startups break up
16:01
the second reason which is similar but
16:04
subtly different is when both or all
16:07
co-founders want to be the CEO the
16:09
actual titles you give yourselves at the
16:11
early stages of a startup don't really
16:14
matter that much because they don't
16:15
really change the work that you do on a
16:17
day-to-day basis but there is something
16:20
symbolic about the CEO title and what it
16:23
says is that this is the person that's
16:26
trusted to make have the final call on
16:28
really hard decisions and even if people
16:31
don't agree with them in the moment
16:33
everybody agrees to disagree and rally
16:36
behind the CEO like the CEO is really
16:37
the sort of true leader of the startup
16:40
it's bad when there are multiple people
16:42
who want to be the CEO because it's
16:44
basically saying I'm the person that
16:47
should really be in charge of this place
16:49
and I don't trust and respect the other
16:51
co-founders to have that the third
16:54
reason that co-founder relationships
16:56
often break up it's really kind of maybe
16:59
arguably similar to not having shared
17:00
goals or values but a specific instance
17:03
of it which is having very different
17:05
work ethic expectations startups are
17:08
very hard and all consuming um there's
17:11
no one to tell you which hours you
17:12
should work or how much you should get
17:14
done in a day it's all up to you to
17:17
Define how much you're working what
17:19
you're working on how you build the
17:21
company and if you and your co-founder
17:23
have very different work ethic
17:25
expectations one of you wants to be
17:27
working all the time like eat work sleep
17:30
but you know the other co-founder wants
17:32
to have more work life balance or just
17:34
feels differently about how they should
17:36
be judged um and what their expectations
17:38
are those relationships get very very
17:41
strained under the stress and pressure
17:43
of a startup and we don't see those
17:45
typically work out so well so again have
17:49
these conversations early on and set
17:50
expectations up front to be sure that
17:52
your co-founder is on the same page as
17:54
you are so how do you avoid getting into
17:57
a co-founder breakup well to some extent
How do you avoid getting into a co-founder breakup?
18:00
it's unavoidable this happens and the
18:02
best lesson you can take is learn from
18:04
the experience and move on and don't
18:06
repeat the same mistake with your next
18:07
startup but having dealt with hundreds
18:10
of co-founder relationships and breakups
18:12
over the years one piece of advice I do
18:14
give is don't avoid disagreements like
18:19
anytime you disagree about
18:21
something have the conversation don't
18:23
delay hard conversations like it's very
18:26
easy for co-founders or people to just
18:28
shortterm about this and what I mean is
18:30
you feel like oh like okay we're
18:32
disagreeing or I'm upset about something
18:34
but I don't want to rock the boat like
18:36
we've got so much work to do I don't
18:38
want to bring this up right now I'll
18:40
bring it up next week or I'll bring it
18:42
up next month or you always
18:44
procrastinate and you delay on having a
18:46
hard conversation and really I think
18:48
what that does it's like death by a
18:50
Thousand Cuts like it just means that
18:52
pressure just builds up and it builds up
18:53
and it builds up and then when you do
18:56
eventually spill over and say something
18:58
you're now so heated that it's it's not
19:01
possible to have a calm conversation
19:03
where you work things out it becomes
19:04
very emotional um and confrontational
19:07
and that really damages the relationship
19:09
and so my tactical advice on this would
19:12
be set up regular one-on ones with your
19:15
co-founder and that may sound a little
19:17
formal but something I did with my
19:19
startups is I would just put time on the
19:21
calendar at the end of every month where
19:24
we would just go for a drink or a meal
19:27
and just talk about how we would doing
19:29
like we were just check in and like do
19:30
we think things are going well are we
19:32
excited like how are like the two of us
19:35
uh working together and if you put that
19:37
on the calendar and commit to it it
19:39
gives you a opportunity to regularly
19:42
release some of the pressure that every
19:44
startup co-founder relationship has
19:46
slowly over time rather than having it
19:48
all build up and come out in one big
19:50
burst so I hopefully I've convinced you
19:51
of a few things one that you really
19:53
should get a co-founder if you want to
19:55
start a company because it's just
Summary
19:57
incredibly hard to be successful with
19:59
that one two that you should ideally
20:02
start a company with somebody you
20:03
already know like somebody you have a
20:05
sense of what their skills are and how
20:08
they cope with stress and three even if
20:11
you have a great co-founder relationship
20:12
you will still have to work hard to
20:14
maintain that relationship um and avoid
20:17
it getting stressed and fractured over
20:18
time by having difficult conversations
20:21
regularly I really hope you find a great
20:23
co-founder best of luck with the search
20:25
and I hope to see you at yon someday
