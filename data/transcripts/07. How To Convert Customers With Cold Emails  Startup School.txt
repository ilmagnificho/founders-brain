Intro

hi I'm aarin Epstein group partner at YC and in this video I'm going to talk all about how to write cold emails that
0:16
convert so first I'm going to give you the all-time best email Outreach hack
0:21
you ready get a warm intro this is the most effective way to get people to
0:26
respond to emails that you're sending to them and you're going to have a conversion rate two to three times what
0:33
you would get if you were just sending a regular cold email and so there's a lot of different ways to get warm intros to
0:39
people that you're trying to get in touch with mostly you want to use your network and go through Linkedin all of
0:45
your contacts look up your friends your friends of friends current or former
0:51
co-workers your uh School alumni networks that you're a part of and even
0:56
employer um alumni networks at past companies that you've worked at and you basically want to turn over every Rock
1:03
in stone to try to find people that might be able to get you a warm connection to the person that you're
1:09
trying to get in touch with it's not always possible to get a warm intro though and many times you got to go in
1:16
cold so that's going to be a big focus of what we're talking about in this video whether it's for sales recruiting
1:23
Partnerships or whether you're just trying to get some of your users to talk to you or even reach out to other uh
1:29
founders as mentors to be able to give you advice all of the tips in this video should be useful for you and the good
1:36
news is that most cold emails are actually terrible so the bar is really
1:41
low for you to stand out and get somebody to pay attention and respond to you so the first thing that I'm going to
Map your funnel
1:48
talk about here is mapping out your funnel and to do this you want to start with your goal and for many of you if
1:54
this is a sales context your goal is going to be I want to get new customers so your goal is to get one new customer
2:01
let's say and then what you want to do is you want to work backwards from that goal to build your funnel which I'll
2:07
walk you through now so we're going to take a look at what a typical conversion funnel might look like if you're a B2B
2:14
software company I'll give some sample conversion rates as we go through this example here um but it's important to
2:20
note that yours may differ and you're going to need to figure that out through trial and error yourselves so let's say
2:25
your goal is to get that one customer and then let's say you have a a funnel where you actually need to give product
2:32
demos to convert people to a customer and so let's say you know that your demo to customer conversion rate is 10% well
2:39
in order to get one customer that means you're going to have to give 10 demos to get that one customer now in order to
2:46
get 10 demos let's say you know that you have a 25% conversion rate from people that
2:53
respond to your email to people that actually sign up and show up for a demo so that means that you need 40 responses
3:01
from the emails that you send in order to get 10 demos now in order to get 40
3:06
responses you need 400 people to open your email if you have a 10% conversion
3:13
rate from opens to responses and then in order to get 400 people to open your email if you have a
3:20
50% conversion rate from emails sent to emails opened that means that you need
3:25
to have you need to send 800 emails to get those 400 opens so when you look at
3:31
this all in aggregate basically what that means is you need to send 800 emails in order to get one customer
3:38
conversion so if you're expecting to just send a handful of emails every day every week every month and see results
3:46
that's not going to cut it you're going to need to send dozens of emails per day
3:52
possibly even 50 per day in order to see meaningful results with conversion rates
3:57
similar to those that I showed and you should plan to start this writing these emails manually and personalized doing
4:05
it yourself not starting with automation you have to do it manually first so that
4:11
you can learn and figure out what works so that you can then start to scale the process more and it's important to
4:18
remember that the goal is not to make the sale right away in the first email your goal should be actually to get to
4:25
the next step in the funnel that's all you should be focused on here and as you're optimizing your funnel you want
4:32
to make sure that you're tracking and measuring your conversion rates so you can figure out what they are for your
4:37
specific situation and this is really important because it helps you understand where to focus your efforts
4:43
if you have an especially low conversion rate at one step in the funnel it might mean that there's a lot of room for
4:49
improvement that you can do to bring those numbers up which will help improve your conversion rates across the entire
4:55
funnel and I wish I could give you industry standard conversion rates for each of these steps but the truth is
5:02
they're all different it really depends on your industry your brand your product
5:07
and even the customer type that you're going after but one thing that's important to note is that conversion
5:12
rates will decrease as you scale so if you're starting out in the early days
5:18
and you're writing these emails manually and you're not getting good conversion rates then that's something you should
5:23
fix before you start to scale because they're only going to get worse as you grow in scale because by definition
5:31
you're going to be going after potential customers that are not your most ideal Target as you are starting to grow all
5:38
right now let's talk about how you can increase open rates the most effective way to increase your open rates is going
5:43
to come through better targeting we talk a lot at YC about making something people want and targeting is really all
5:50
about finding the people that want it and this is the highest leverage thing that you can do to improve your open
5:56
rates and your responses because it's better to send send 100 targeted emails
6:01
that are going to have a much higher open rate much higher likelihood to respond rather than a thousand
6:08
untargeted emails that are mostly going to be deleted and the thing is you should get better at this over time as
6:14
you learn to qualify your leads better so this is an iterative process this is effectively the screen that your
6:21
recipients are going to see when they're trying to decide if they should open your email or delete it it's an email
6:27
client you basically see the name of the sender and you see the subject line and
6:32
maybe a tiny preview of that first sentence in the email so the from in
6:37
your email should just be your personal name it's better because it feels like it's coming from a human rather than a
6:44
company and the subject should be something that's short relevant interesting hey quick question can I get
6:50
your advice help a fellow founder hello from your company name these are all
6:57
great examples that are just really simple don't feel over ly salesy and feels like you know your friend could
7:02
have written it and when reaching out to people I found that the ideal channels to contact our email is usually better
7:10
LinkedIn is usually worse and if you're text messaging somebody it can be even
7:16
more personal but only do that if you have their explicit permission otherwise
7:21
if you get a text from somebody and you don't know them it can almost feel like an invasion of privacy sometimes now
7:27
this isn't always true for all Industries there's some people where you know they get LinkedIn messages all the
7:33
time and it feels overwhelming for them and they're feel like it's filled with Spam and so you don't want to fall in
7:39
that category there's some people that never get LinkedIn messages and it feels special to them when somebody reaches
7:44
out so you're going to have to adapt this for your own specific industry and use case when it comes to finding
Finding emails
7:50
strangers emails there's a few different ways that you can go about that first is you can ask someone who knows them uh if
7:57
they have their email address that they can sh with you although an intro from that person would obviously be better
8:03
you can uh try to connect with them on LinkedIn um or look up their blog or the
8:09
website if they have one oftentimes people will put their own personal email address there you can use the LinkedIn
8:15
sales Navigator tool which is a great way to find relevant people to reach out to and also contact and then sometimes
8:23
you can even guess based on the company format if you know that everyone at the company has first name. last name at
8:30
companyname tocom then you can probably guess just about anybody who's working there and be able to reach them and then
8:35
there are even really great tools that can help make this pretty simple too like apollo.io hunter.io clear bid and
8:42
many others so it's worth checking those out to be able to find the right email address to find somebody building your
8:48
brand is really important when you're reaching out it's important because your company brand when you're really small
8:55
actually isn't going to help you it's not going to open doors nobody knows who you are are but it will help you as you
9:01
scale if you do things right and so what's important to remember in the early days is that you are the brand the
9:08
words that you use the way that you reach out the level of personalization and the effort and work that you've
9:13
shown in reaching out to somebody will really stand out to people you basically are trying to get users customers
9:21
Partners to not just make a bet on your company but to make a bet on you personally in order to work with you
9:27
it's risky working with a startup and so if you can put your personal cell phone number in there and tell them to reach
9:34
out to you at any hour of the night if there's anything that they need that's going to feel like you really care and
9:41
you're going above and beyond to make them successful but it's important to remember that the highest Roi when it
9:47
comes to increasing open rates is really going to come from better targeting now let's talk about ways to get more
How to get more responses?
9:53
responses once people have opened your email it all comes down to what you write and what you say in that email
10:00
whether they're going to respond or take the action that you want and so in order to guide you through this I've come up
10:05
with seven principles of effective email copy that are going to help you write emails that stand out the first is to
10:13
have a focus specific goal your goal can be getting to the next step in the
10:18
funnel and starting a conversation with them and you want to keep it focused on a single outcome you want them to
10:25
respond to click to intro you to somebody whatever the action is that that you want them to take and you want
10:31
to focus just on that one outcome and moving them towards that action if you
10:36
have multiple asks or multiple things that you want them to do in the email it can create a paradox of choice and then
10:43
this feels hard and overwhelming for the recipient if they have too many things they want to do or it's not clear which
10:49
is important and they're just going to either delete your email or shelf it and archive it and forget about it and move
10:56
on so that's why it's really important that you have this one Focus goal and all the copy in your email should drive
11:04
towards that single goal and every word counts if there's anything that doesn't
11:09
move the recipient towards that goal you should delete it the second principle
11:15
for writing effective emails is to be human this really helps to talk about emotions things like I'd love to it
11:22
would mean a lot I'd really appreciate thanks you have no idea how much this helped because humans talk about emot
11:30
and Bots or llms or whatever else you're using to try to automate this process is not good at this type of thing and it
11:36
helps to be informal instead of hello or sometimes I get emails hello Mr Epstein
11:42
and I don't take those very seriously versus if somebody says hey or hey Aaron and you can even have no capitalization
11:50
typos can be okay these are all things that make me think that a human has written this email rather than a robot
11:57
and you can even get creative with gifts or videos or other types of custom content to get people's attention and
12:03
the more personalized it is the better I remember one time somebody sent me an email and in it they had an animated
12:10
gift of them holding a little whiteboard and it said Aaron it had my name on it it said hi Aon and she's waving to me
12:17
and so that got my attention I clicked through I wanted to see what this was about because it felt like they had done
12:22
something that was very personalized that probably took time to create and that made me think that they actually
12:28
cared about building a connection with me rather than just spamming thousands of people of which I was one of them and
12:34
I think the main point to emphasize here is that you really want to write how you talk to a friend this is super important
12:41
a lot of times people will go and they'll open up a Google doc and they'll start writing out a generic email with
12:47
sequences and placeholder variables for company name and recipient name and all
12:52
these things and that's not a good way to do it instead you want to open up
12:58
your email editor just like you're composing an actual email to a single person put the specific person's name or
13:06
email address in the two field and then write the email with that specific
13:12
person in mind and I know it's tempting to use llms and other techniques to try to automate a lot of this but they often
13:18
struggle with a lot of this personal connection here and then final trick here once you've written that
13:24
personalized email to one specific person read it out loud either to your co-found founder if you have one or to
13:30
yourself and see if it feels awkward anything that you're saying if there's something that you've written that you
13:37
wouldn't feel comfortable saying out loud to somebody that's probably an indication that you should change it to
13:42
be a little more human the third principle here is to personalize everyone's used to getting
13:48
tons of spam and people can smell spam from a mile away so that's why personalization and making it feel
13:55
targeted is super important to avoid the delete button everyone loves their name
14:00
so the difference between hi there which feels generic versus hey Aaron feels
14:06
like it was written for me very simple to do very simple bar across and it helps to be specific in the
14:12
personalization that you're writing a lot of times I see Founders say things like hey love what you're doing at
14:19
creative Market which was my startup which feels kind of generic it feels like there was a a placeholder variable
14:25
for company name and they just swapped my company name in instead if somebody writes to me and they say
14:31
something like I'm a huge creative Market fan ever since you launched the photos category it's now my go-to
14:37
resource that shows me that the very least they've done some research on my
14:42
product and the history of of what we've built and how it's evolved and at the
14:48
highest level maybe they're actually a user of my product in which case I would be super excited to respond to them and
14:54
get to know them so the key takeaway here is that if you're just swapping out a few words it's probably not specific
15:01
enough and one really important Point here to help with personalization is you want to try to find the uncommon
15:07
commonalities with the people that you're reaching out to now uncommon commonalities are things that you have
15:14
uniquely in common with somebody else things that are not obvious to have in
15:19
common with other people so for example if I'm reaching out to somebody and I say hey I see that you are a man I also
15:27
am a man we should do business this together then they're going to be like okay that's a little weird it's a lot of
15:33
people that are like that versus if somebody reaches out to me and they say hey we went to the same college and went
15:40
to class in the same buildings instantly I'm starting to build a connection with them or I feel like we have something in
15:46
common and I want to get to know them better and I want to help support them because I know what it's like to be in
15:52
their shoes as well and it's not easy to figure out what these uncommon commonalities are and so that means that
15:58
you have to do the work you have to put in the work to research the company find
16:04
the right contact look them up on LinkedIn use their product so you
16:10
understand at a deep level how it works and then reach out to the person and that's how you're going to be able to
16:16
build the deepest connections and get the most responses all right the next principle is to keep it short if you've
16:22
got a wall of text that's just going to be an instant delete for most recipients
16:27
and really what you want to focus on on here is you want it to be short because your email will then be easy to read and
16:34
respond to right away most people are pulling up emails on their phone and if
16:39
you can make it so simple that they can just hit reply fire off a quick response
16:44
quick a link whatever the thing is that you want they're going to do it right there in the moment if it's something
16:50
that has more cognitive overhead longer to read then it means that people are going to put it on archive maybe flag it
16:58
to try to resp respond later or else just delete it all together and your email will be lost the fifth principle
17:04
for effective cold emails is to establish credibility if you're in YC
17:10
often that can be credibility enough to open doors but if you're not in YC this can be through former schools that
17:17
you've attended companies that you've worked at or other impressive things that you've done you can include all of
17:23
this in your email to get people to take you seriously right out of the gate also if your company is live and you have
17:30
customers you can share some well-known customer names as social proof in the email too if people see that either
17:37
they're competitors or other well-known customer names that they know are using your product then that can provide a lot
17:44
of credibility for them to get excited to use you too and if you have any interesting or useful data or Trends or
17:50
anything that's industry specific that your customers might find interesting or relevant you can publish that too to
17:57
help establish your yourself as an expert in the space and if you have any shared connections people that you know
18:03
in Comm and that sort of thing it can be great to mention that too because that'll create a baseline of trust the
18:10
sixth principle here is that it's all about the reader not about you and so
18:16
this means as you're writing your copy you want to reframe all the eyes as you
18:21
and yours and really the trick here is to tell your story as the quest to solve
18:27
the problems for your users and this works especially well if you are solving
18:33
a problem that you have felt yourself so for example if you know at your past
18:38
company you ran into this problem it was a huge headache for you and now you're
18:43
building this company to solve it you should tell the user that and tell them that you're dedicating the next 10 years
18:51
of your life to build this company to solve this problem that you felt so deeply that you know that they feel too
18:58
people are really going to connect if they know that you understand their problem too and they're going to want to
19:04
share everything with you so that you can hopefully fix it for them it's also important that you use the language that
19:10
your users use to describe you not necessarily how you think about how you
19:16
describe your company a good trick for this is to ask your users say how would
19:21
you describe my company and they'll typically tell you in a short phrase how
19:27
they would describe it and and you want to take that exact phrase and use that as the language when reaching out to
19:33
other customers and I would even recommend putting that exact phrase right as the header on your website
19:40
because the language that your users use to describe you is almost certainly the same language that's going to resonate
19:46
with other people just like them and then it's important to remember you shouldn't make demands in these emails
19:52
respond to me by this date or whatever you're on their time you're in their inbox and it's not their responsibility
20:00
to get back to you finally the last principle number seven here is to have a clear call to action you want to end
20:07
with a concrete Next Step reply to let me know click here to get started Can
20:12
You intro me to Aaron Or whoever you're trying to get in touch with this makes it really clear what action you want the
20:20
user to take and then it's really important to make this its own paragraph make it its own Standalone sentence
20:26
right before you sign off at the end often times people will scan an email get down to the end and try to figure
20:33
out what is it they're asking me to do is this something that I could take care of right now in just a few seconds or is
20:39
this something that's going to take more time and effort in which case I'm going to have to think about it and process it
20:44
some more so by ending with a clear call to action you're more likely to get somebody to take that next step all
20:51
right so these are the seven principles of effective email copy have a focus
20:56
specific goal be human human personalize keep it short establish
21:03
credibility make sure it's all about the reader not about you and have a clear
21:08
call to action and if you do all of these things the good news is you'll be
21:14
the top 5% of all emails that are sent and it's going to be hard for your
21:19
recipients to ignore them but one email is often not enough people are busy
21:26
they're out on vacation they get distracted and so you should plan to manually follow up two three four times as needed
21:34
and now there's a fine line between being persistent and being annoying so you want to give it a few days between
21:40
emails and also you can get creative with each follow-up I've done this in the past I was emailing somebody they
21:47
weren't responding send an email subject line free donuts they opened that one
21:53
and I went and brought some donuts to their office to get them to talk to me so sometimes you just got to get creative and then if somebody doesn't
21:59
respond don't get angry don't get frustrated nobody owes you anything here
22:04
just move on you can check back in in a couple months maybe it's not a problem for them right now maybe it will be in
22:10
the future all right so let's see some examples so first we're going to take a look at a couple emails that are not
Examples
22:16
effective and need some work and we'll critique those and then we're going to take a look at a few emails that are
22:22
actually really effective and point out some of the good parts of them and it's worth noting these are actually real
22:28
email emails that I have received and I'm going to be reading them out of my inbox but I'll be anonymizing some of
22:34
the details to protect the innocent here all right so the first one says hi Aaron
22:39
hope all is well wanted to follow up because I noticed your order processing time could be faster our company plugs
22:46
into your e-commerce platform to pull orders in real time and guarantees all orders are fulfilled and on their way to
22:52
your customer within one day or your money back all right the problem with this is that my company sold digital
22:59
design assets that were downloadable from the internet we did not ship physical products so clearly this is a
23:07
company that's trying to sell me a shipment service and because this is not targeted we are never going to be their
23:15
customer this could have been the most amazingly written most personalized email and nothing that they could do
23:22
would make me their Customer because the targeting is not right so this illustrates the importance of having
23:28
really strong targeting with your emails and why that will help you see much better conversion rates all right this
23:35
next one hey there hope you are doing great I've just checked your website and your audience and content look
23:41
interesting to us so here's a quick question do you partner with companies or collaborate somehow to make extra
23:47
bucks best in waiting for your reply PS if you don't want to hear from me anymore just let me know okay a lot of
23:55
problems with this one first they didn't even have my name it just says hey there so they couldn't be bo bothered to
24:01
personalize with my own name so not a great start there's nothing personalized
24:06
in here checked out your website your audience looks interesting to us and then I think this is their ask do you
24:14
collaborate somehow to make extra bucks I don't even know what they're specifically asking for here and then
24:20
finally nobody actually signed their name to this email and the PS says if
24:25
you don't want to hear from me anymore just let me know which is basically telling me that this is Spam they've
24:31
added me to some list and now it's my responsibility to get off that list so this is an an example of an email that I
24:39
could not delete fast enough okay here's the last one which I almost instantly
24:44
deleted hi Aaron my name is so and so from the Philippines I saw your LinkedIn
24:50
profile and took an educated guess and sending this email you don't need to tell somebody um how you found their
24:57
contact information that's relevant to you not relevant to them I'm a freelancer that offers
25:02
contractual work to Executives all around the globe I have been helping companies since 2014 during my past jobs
25:09
I was able to facilitate good business relationships I can help assist you in your sales team I hope to share my
25:15
skills and expertise with you you can see that this is all about the person
25:20
who's sending it not about the recipient at all basically everything about this email is I I I it's it's all focused on
25:29
the person who sent it not on me the recipient and why I should reach back out to this person to work with them so
25:37
this is an example of not focusing on the recipient make sure it's all focused
25:42
on how you can help their problems that's all they care about all right now let's take a look at some good ones that
25:48
actually worked well on me and converted first one subject line go turps this was a LinkedIn message of which I respond to
25:55
very few of them hope you don't mind the cold reach out but saw you also spent time in Van munching Hall so I went to
26:02
the University of Maryland the Maryland terapin which we call the TPS um and I actually had a number of classes in Van
26:09
munching Hall on campus so right away this is somebody that it says to me um
26:14
has context when I went to school likely went there themselves um we have some uncommon commonalities uh together here
26:21
as a quick intro my co-founder and I are both exg googlers working together on a meeting driven task manager so this
26:28
tells me they're building some credibility they've worked at Google in the past makes me think maybe they're uh
26:35
solid Engineers I was hoping you might help out a fellow TP and review my YC app
26:40
I've already had a few friends review so it's been cleaned up significantly and this is really helpful because it tells
26:47
me that they've done the work to get it to a point where they're not going to be wasting my time and that I'm going to be
26:53
able to help them with the high value things not the obvious loow hanging fruit if you have a few moments let me
27:00
know the best email to send you the doc and thanks in advance so this is a very clear call to action share your email
27:06
with me and they'll follow up with a doc that I can just leave some feedback in so this was super effective I responded
27:13
to this person um when that's something that I very rarely do okay now this next
27:18
example is one that I actually wrote myself uh back when we were launching creative Market Marketplace for graphic
27:24
design assets and we were recruiting some designers to be our first sellers on the marketplace when we open the
27:30
doors want to be one of the first creative Market Sellers and start adding your stuff we're just starting to open
27:36
the doors for sellers to come in and add their content to be ready on day one of launch here's a special link to start
27:42
setting up your shop it's still super early in the rollout process for us so I'd love any thoughts or feedback you
27:48
have on how things are working right now we're working hard to improve things every day but definitely let me know if
27:54
you run into any bugs weirdness or anything else you think we should know your feedback is super important to us
28:01
oh and please don't share any info or screenshots about the new site and the seller terms with anyone else just yet
28:07
we're inviting handpick sellers only at this point so trying to keep it super exclusive for now welcome to the club
28:13
look forward to hearing your thoughts so what's interesting about this email is this is entirely a templated email
28:21
except for the person's first name and the special URL that they need to come and sign up early but I use use a lot of
28:28
tricks throughout in order to make it feel very special and personalized so for one it's bunch of smiley faces you
28:36
know makes it feel a little more informal um I write how I talk you know it's like oh and please don't share any
28:43
info that sort of thing I also use the word special and make it feel exclusive a lot here's a special link it's super
28:50
early for us i' love your feedback we're working hard to make it better um don't
28:56
share anything because you know we're inviting handpick people only at this point it's exclusive welcome to the club
29:04
so it makes it feel very special for the recipient rather than something that I'm spamming out to everybody and hoping
29:10
anyone responds to me okay and this last email is going to be a little bit different we're going to do a before and
29:16
after with a company that I worked with in the batch a few years back now they were uh company that sell uh in-office
29:24
smoothie machines and pre-made smoothies that they were trying to get startups and other companies bu subscriptions
29:31
with them and so they had this email they were sending out hey we're in the current YC batch hustling to achieve our
29:37
demo day goal can you forward me to your office manager to chat about trying our delicious smoothies in the office for
29:43
free in exchange for feedback to improve our product we got Uber Fitbit GoPro and
29:49
others using us and thought your team would enjoy them too so there's some good stuff in here they've got the
29:55
social proof that Uber Fitbit GoPro those are logos that we recognize so it
30:00
makes it seem like they're more legit but you know it's all about them trying to get their demo day goal and um you
30:06
know it doesn't seem as enticing for somebody to want to try to help them out it's less clear what's in it for the
30:12
recipient so after brainstorming a bit and iterating on it here's what we came up with working with the founders the
30:18
subject was smoothie party current YC company hey first name I'm Oliver the
30:24
founder of snack Blends from the current YC badge and I'd love to throw free Smoothie party for the whole company
30:30
team at your office it's like happy hour but smoothies and free are you
30:36
interested all we ask in return is for some feedback on the smoothies is there an afternoon I can come by to treat your
30:42
team thanks and so when they started doing this one it almost seemed like a no-brainer for their recipients yeah
30:49
free Smoothie party somebody's going to come and give smoothies to my team sounds great and so that helped get them
30:54
in the door to be able to then sell those um as long term deals all right so
Final thoughts
31:00
I'm going to leave you with some final advice here the first you should be doing this manually to learn and focus
31:07
on scaling later if you're trying to automate right out of the gate you're doing it wrong instead if closing
31:14
customers by sending cold emails is an important part of your growth strategy
31:20
you should be blocking off hours per day to do this and do it incredibly well
31:25
it's worth it for the return once you've got it working really well with you doing it personally then you can try to
31:33
figure out how to automate and scale the process more in order to do that you've got to be tracking and measuring
31:39
remember that funnel you got to figure out at each step of the funnel what's the conversion rate how can I improve it
31:46
figure out where you're dropping off and focus on those areas you the founders should be sending these people are going
31:52
to take them way more seriously when it comes from the founders or the CEO much
31:58
more so than if it comes from some account executive or some intern or some
32:03
other automated process that you set up here and you should be sending dozens of emails per day block off the time and do
32:11
the work to get it right and you will see the results so you may be small but
32:16
that is your advantage because you can give your personalized attention to making these dedicated emails feel
32:22
special to the recipient so personalize be human be persistent and do the work
32:29
so thanks for watching and I hope this video helps you turn more of your cold emails into customers thanks
