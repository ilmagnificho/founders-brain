How To Keep Your Users  Startup School

At YC our motto is make something people want. But how do you actually know if you’ve accomplished that in the early days? One of the best ways to measure successful growth is a concept called cohort retention, which tracks the fraction of new users that come back time and time again to use your product. In this episode of Startup School, YC Group Partner David Lieb explains how to define cohorts, track active users and determine the appropriate time frame for measuring successful retention rates.

[Music]
0:09
hi everyone I'm David Lee I am a group
0:11
partner here at YC YC has a famously
0:15
simple motto make something people want
0:18
I think it's the purest statement of the
0:20
job of startup Founders and we talk
0:22
about this a lot but what gets talked
0:24
about a lot less is how do you know if
0:28
you've actually done it did we make
0:30
something people want today I want to go
0:33
deep on the single best way that I have
0:36
found to answer this question and do it
0:38
in a really quantitative way and that is
0:41
cohort retention so high level cohort
Cohort Retention
0:45
retention is uh the idea of tracking
0:48
what fraction of your new users keep
0:50
using your product over time now this
0:53
isn't a New Concept there's actually a
0:55
ton of content on the internet about
0:57
cohort retention it's even built into
0:59
most analytics tools that you might be
1:01
using but I bet that you don't fully
1:04
understand what it measures and how to
1:06
interpret the numbers and the reason I
1:09
suspect that you don't understand it is
1:10
that I didn't understand it u in my
1:13
startup until many many years later uh
1:16
when it was nearly too late I remember
1:18
one specific moment I was uh pitching a
1:21
very prestigious VC firm uh for our
1:23
seriesa and they asked me hey Dave how's
1:27
your cohort retention and I gave them a
1:29
very handwavy answer and then after the
1:31
meeting I went on my computer and I
1:33
googled cohort retention and I realized
1:35
that what I said must have made
1:37
absolutely no sense so I hope that I can
1:39
save you that mistake here with this
1:41
video so before we dive in uh quick
1:43
background on me uh I did YC back in the
1:46
summer of 2009 with my startup bump bump
1:49
let you share contact information and
1:52
photos with other people by just
1:54
literally bumping your phones together
1:56
bump was one of the first mobile apps to
1:58
reach more than 100 million users but It
2:01
ultimately didn't work as a business
2:03
thankfully we did a few pivots into the
2:06
photo sharing and photo management space
2:08
and ultimately were acquired by Google
2:11
where our our last app um a photo
2:13
management app formed the basis for
2:15
Google photos which I then worked on for
2:18
nearly a decade uh and Google photos
2:20
today serves well more than a billion
2:22
users so I've made something that a lot
2:24
of people want but I've also learned the
2:26
very hard way how to know when you have
2:29
not yet made something that people want
Key Insight
2:31
okay so the key insight and the reason
2:33
it's called cohort retention um is that
2:36
we're going to track individual groups
2:38
of new users or cohorts over time
2:41
instead of trying to look at the user
2:43
base or all of your customers kind of
2:45
mixed together and make some inferences
2:46
from that and this gives you a much
2:48
better sense of how individual users
2:51
continue to use your product over time
2:53
or don't so to do this we have to Define
2:56
three things first how we are going to
2:59
isolate the cohorts uh then we're going
3:02
to have to talk about what action we
3:04
will use that counts a user as an active
3:06
user or not and finally we have to pick
3:09
which time period we want to measure uh
3:12
subsequent usage in so let's dive into
3:15
each of these so for cohorts um we have
3:18
to pick a way to group new users into
3:21
individual groups the most common way
3:23
you do this is simply by when they first
3:25
used your product so you might look at
3:28
new users you acquire each week so week
3:30
one then week two um or maybe by month
3:33
here are all the new users that we got
3:35
in January that's one cohort here are
3:37
all the new users we got in February
3:38
that's another cohort that is typically
3:40
the best place to start but as you get a
3:43
little bit deeper and more advanced in
3:44
this you can additionally slice by other
3:47
dimensions like country or region or how
3:50
you acquired that user maybe what device
3:53
they are using or other you know
3:56
characteristics of that customer next
3:58
let's talk about actions so the action
4:01
is the way to define like what qualifies
4:03
a user to be counted as an active user
4:06
in each subsequent time period the
4:08
simplest way to do this is just did they
4:11
open our app did they visit our site um
4:14
but a better way would be to pick a
4:16
specific feature um that you want to
4:18
track that is more correlated with them
4:20
actually using your product uh maybe
4:23
that's you know posting a photo if
4:25
you're building a social network or you
4:27
know using a specific workflow in your
4:29
B2B tool that you're building so let's
4:31
let's look at some examples of what you
4:33
know popular companies might choose
4:35
let's say your Instagram uh you would
4:37
probably want to pick an action that
4:39
relates to users actually seeing content
4:41
in Instagram so maybe I would pick
4:43
viewed three or more posts on Instagram
4:46
and the reason I picked three is that
4:48
sometimes people will open up Instagram
4:50
not touch the screen at all not get any
4:52
value and immediately leave you probably
4:54
want to filter those people out as
4:55
active users if you're uber you might
4:58
pick completed a ride actually like took
5:00
a ride ended up in a destination as an
5:02
active user of uber for Google photos
5:04
for my product we chose whether a user
5:07
actually tapped in and viewed a photo
5:09
full screen on their phone as the best
5:11
measure of whether they were an active
5:13
user because we know that if you viewed
5:14
a photo full screen either yours or
5:16
someone else's that was shared to you uh
5:18
you were actually getting value from the
5:20
product so the best action to pick is
Best action to pick.
5:22
one that is really correlated with the
5:24
user getting real value from your
5:26
product and you want to try to filter
5:28
away things where a user might be
5:30
touching your product in some way but
5:32
not getting real value okay so last you
5:35
have to also Define the time period that
5:37
you're going to measure this on so what
5:39
I mean by this is the granularity of
5:41
time that you're going to look at when
5:43
you're counting whether a user performed
5:45
the action that we just talked about
5:47
typically this should be a time period
5:49
that is you know most connected to the
5:52
desired usage of your product um so let
5:55
me give you some examples if you're
5:57
building a social app or an
5:59
entertainment app maybe your Instagram
6:01
or Tik Tok or YouTube you probably
6:03
intend for your user to use your product
6:05
every day so the time period in which
6:07
we're going to measure the cohort
6:09
retention should be daily if you're
6:10
building a utility product maybe
6:12
something like Google photos or Uber
6:14
where you don't think a user would
6:16
necessarily use it every single day uh
6:18
maybe weekly is a better uh time period
6:20
to use if you're a travel app let's say
6:23
you're Airbnb um people don't travel
6:26
more than three or four times a year so
6:28
Airbnb probably would want to track
6:30
something on a larger time granularity
6:32
larger time period maybe quarterly or
6:34
maybe even like semiannually or annually
6:37
and the key here is you want to pick a
6:38
time period that matches what you intend
6:41
for your product and we can talk about
6:43
ways that uh you might screw that up
6:46
later on okay so now let's walk through
6:48
an actual example and talk through how
6:51
we're actually going to measure this in
6:52
detail so what you see here in front of
6:54
you is what we call a triangle chart
6:57
down the rows you can see every month so
7:00
we're going to choose our cohorts by
7:02
month so all the new users in January
7:04
we're going to isolate all the new users
7:06
in February we will isolate and so on
7:09
and then what we're going to do is track
7:11
those users in every subsequent month
7:13
that happens so in this first row and
7:16
First Column you see that we had 12 new
7:18
users in the month of January and what
7:20
we'll do now is look in February one
7:22
month later how many of those 12 users
7:24
came back and performed our action in
7:26
the month of February and we see that
7:28
it's six and then we'll look in March
7:31
two months later and see that we had
7:32
four people come back in the month of
7:34
March the key here is that we're
7:35
counting each person one time during
7:38
that time period regardless of whether
7:39
they came back one time in the month or
7:41
10 times in the month each user gets
7:43
counted one time and you can also see if
7:45
we go to the next month we actually get
7:47
five people to come back from that
7:49
original group of 12 so the key is this
7:51
number can go up or down it can never be
7:54
bigger than the initial group in the
7:56
first month of the cohort because that's
7:58
the total number of people we're going
7:59
to look at and then we'll do the same
8:01
thing for February so February we had 27
8:03
New users and in subsequent months now
8:06
you can see how many of them came back
8:08
each month I like to think about this as
8:10
a party say you're having a party you've
8:11
got your room um when people come into
8:13
the room you kind of tag them you give
8:15
them like a little sticker that says
8:17
what month they came to your party in
8:19
and so all the people that joined in
8:20
January were going to put a January
8:22
sticker on their shirt all the people
8:23
that came in February we're going to put
8:25
a February sticker and then every month
8:27
we're going to look at the people in our
8:28
party and we're going to count how many
8:30
of you people came from the January
8:32
cohort how many of you came from the
8:33
February cohort and that's the way that
8:35
we're actually like dividing up the user
8:37
base and tracking these cohorts
8:39
individually over time one last thing to
8:41
call out here in this triangle chart you
8:43
can see I've highlighted in yellow this
8:45
diagonal line and the diagonal line in
8:47
this type of chart actually represents
8:49
one real calendar month so the yellow
8:52
line here is the month of December and
8:54
so you can see all of the users that
8:56
used our product in the month of
8:57
December where did they come from from
8:59
which cohort were they a part of
9:01
initially and you can see if you added
9:03
up all the numbers along this diagonal
9:05
you would get the total number of users
9:07
that used our product in December so
9:08
that's just an orientation of how we
9:10
measure this you know kind of on the
9:11
ground now these numbers are great but
9:13
what we actually care about is what the
9:16
trends look like relative to the initial
9:18
cohort size so in this graph we've just
9:21
taken the previous one and divided by
9:22
the initial cohort size to kind of
9:24
normalize and get percentages so you can
9:26
see the First Column the initial month
9:28
it's % by definition and then every
9:31
subsequent month now we're measuring
9:33
what fraction of the initial cohort
9:35
returned during the month so this is a
9:37
great visualization you can kind of see
9:39
if you look across the rows how each of
9:41
your cohorts performs over time which we
9:43
really care about and you can also look
9:45
down a column and look at all the rows
9:47
in a column and see whether you are
9:50
generally improving over time with each
9:52
subsequent cohort or if you're generally
9:54
getting worse but I think the best way
9:56
to look at this is to actually take this
9:58
chart and graph it as a line graph and
10:01
that's what you can see here so this is
10:03
typically what we look at when we're
10:04
talking about looking at cohort
10:05
retention curves um so every line on
10:08
this graph is one of our cohorts you
10:10
know the December cohort the November
10:12
cohort the July cohort the longest
10:14
cohort the one that started in January
10:16
has a full 11 months of data and the
10:19
newest cohorts the ones that started in
10:21
November and December only have a couple
10:23
data points at the top so you can see
10:25
this is kind of like a typical way to
10:27
look at a cohort retention curve okay so
What is good?
10:30
I know you're thinking what is good how
10:32
do I know if my cohort retention curves
10:35
are good or if they're really bad so
10:37
before I tell you the answer let's walk
10:38
through an exaggerated example and maybe
10:41
you'll be able to uh see for yourself
10:43
what is the right answer so let's assume
10:45
we have two products product a and
10:47
product B A is the the black line B is
10:50
the orange line here and we're going to
10:52
show the cohort retention curves for
10:54
these two products over time as we
10:56
gather more data each month so at the
10:58
beginning you look at this it sure looks
11:00
like product a is the clear winner uh it
11:03
retains way more of its users in the
11:05
first month or two let's reveal a little
11:07
bit more data we can see now product B
11:09
it continues to drop boy it has lost
11:12
more than half of its users in the first
11:13
couple months whereas product a is
11:16
looking pretty good the numbers are
11:18
still well above 50% really great let's
11:20
keep uh revealing a little bit more and
11:23
maybe now you've had a change of heart
11:25
if you're the owner of product B you're
11:27
probably feeling pretty good because
11:30
you're not losing users anymore while
11:31
your absolute number is down to maybe I
11:34
don't know 20% of the initial cohort it
11:36
sure seems like it's stable and flat
11:39
whereas if you're the company behind
11:41
product a you might be starting to think
11:44
about what is wrong with your product
11:46
because it seems like it will go to zero
11:48
and you will eventually churn all of
11:50
your users so this is the core Insight
11:53
behind cohort retention curves the only
11:56
thing that matters and I can't stress
11:58
this enough the only only thing that
11:59
matters is whether your cohort curves
12:02
get flat the shape of the curve is what
12:04
matters not the absolute number the
12:06
absolute number the height at which it
12:08
might get flat it certainly is better if
12:10
it's higher of course um but it doesn't
12:13
matter nearly as much as whether it gets
12:16
flat at all so that's the key Insight
12:18
here the reason getting flat on your
12:21
cohort retention curves really matters
12:23
is it gives you some chance to
12:25
accumulate users over time if your
12:27
curves don't get flat every month you're
12:29
just going to be acquiring new users and
12:31
losing your old users and you're just
12:33
going to be on this treadmill trying to
12:35
keep up forever whereas if you can
12:37
accumulate even a small fraction of your
12:39
initial cohort of users you know that if
12:42
you can keep doing that over time long
12:44
enough you will eventually grow to a
12:47
very large customer base and hopefully
12:48
be able to make a lot of money so if
12:50
your curves don't flatten out I would
12:52
say it's a pretty good sign that you
12:54
haven't yet made something people want
12:56
now in the early days of Google photos
12:58
our we measured weekly cohort retention
13:01
and our curves looked a lot like that
13:03
orange line they would drop off pretty
13:05
quickly but then they would get flat
13:07
somewhere between 20% or 40% depending
13:10
on which country and device we were
13:12
looking at what's interesting is you
13:14
know if you talk to a friend of yours
13:15
and told them yeah 80% of my users leave
13:18
like pretty immediately they it sounds
13:20
pretty bad right it's not a thing you
13:21
would go around bragging about but the
13:22
fact that on Google photos 20% of users
13:26
pretty immediately demonstrated that
13:28
they would stay with the product and use
13:29
it every week for basically forever it
13:33
gave me a lot of confidence in in like 6
13:35
weeks after launch of Google photos I
13:37
was pretty certain that um we would
13:40
eventually be able to get 20% of all
13:42
humans on the planet to use Google
13:43
photos and turns out that's exactly what
13:46
happened four years later we were well
13:48
north of a billion users is probably
13:50
closing in on two billion users now and
13:52
so getting your cohort curves to be flat
13:55
will also give you a lot of confidence
13:57
as a Founder that um you can actually
13:59
build this into a really big thing so
14:02
let's next talk about how you might fool
14:05
yourself into thinking that your cohort
14:06
retention is good when in fact it is not
14:09
and I am going to be speaking from
14:10
experience I have made every single one
14:12
of these mistakes so let's uh dive in to
14:15
what they are the biggest mistake that I
14:17
see people make is picking too large of
14:20
a time period in which to measure your
14:22
subsequent retention so in our example
14:25
you know we picked months if you pick
14:27
quarters or half years um you have a
14:30
much better chance of every user coming
14:32
back and being counted as an active user
14:34
so by definition your cohort curves are
14:37
going to be flatter and higher the
14:39
larger you pick your time period and who
14:41
doesn't want to look better for
14:43
investors for employees just to feel
14:46
better about themselves when they're
14:47
falling asleep at night we all do and so
Ways to fool yourself
14:49
this is something to be consciously
14:51
aware of and also realize that your
14:53
unconscious brain is going to push you
14:56
to widen your cohorts even though you
14:57
probably shouldn't at bump This was um a
15:01
mistake I made uh we would look at our
15:03
weekly cohort retention curves because
15:05
we thought that Weekly was kind of the
15:06
the right period of time that users
15:08
should be using bump and they were
15:10
really bad what we did practically was
15:13
well we have some investor meetings come
15:14
up uh coming up so let's let's just
15:16
widen the cohort to a month and let's
15:18
let's see how they look there and they
15:19
looked better and then we convinced
15:21
ourselves well quarterly actually is a
15:24
reasonable time to to use our product
15:26
let's increase our time period to once a
15:27
quarter and then the cohorts aha looked
15:30
really great but we were fooling
15:31
ourselves right bump was not designed to
15:34
be used once every quarter it was
15:35
designed to be used pretty frequently
15:38
and by um expanding our cohort time
15:40
period we were just deluding ourselves
15:42
about what actually was the state of our
15:44
product another way to uh fool yourself
15:47
in in your cohor retention is picking
15:48
too easy of an action so we talked a
15:51
little bit earlier about you know
15:53
picking an action that is just a user
15:55
opening your app or coming to your site
15:57
I would caution you against picking
16:00
something that easy or that shallow in
16:02
the usage of your product because
16:04
there's lots of ways to game that and
16:06
you will find yourself gaming your
16:08
metrics once you start charting this
16:09
stuff a common example there is using
16:12
notifications or other alerts to drive
16:14
users to your product kind of like
16:17
inorganically maybe and what you'll find
16:19
is they'll get there and then they're
16:21
going to leave immediately and not
16:22
actually get value from your product and
16:24
you don't want to be counting that usage
16:26
in your cohort retention curves because
16:28
it will lead you astray a great example
16:30
I saw at Google when I first joined
16:33
Google was still working on its social
16:35
network Google+ and U there was a point
16:37
in time I kid you not that uh the active
16:40
usage of Google+ was determined by
16:43
whether a users saw in the typ right
16:46
corner of every Google product a little
16:49
notification Bell that would have a red
16:51
uh notification if you had a a Google+
16:53
notification somebody added you as a
16:55
friend you had a new photo that got
16:57
uploaded something like that and by
16:59
doing that it made the active user
17:01
numbers really big and so everybody felt
17:03
good but if you looked at the cohort
17:05
retention it was a lie um these were not
17:09
active users these were people who were
17:10
in their Gmail and they happen to like
17:12
click on this little red bell to see
17:14
what it is and they got counted as an
17:16
active user of go+ so don't make
17:18
mistakes like that it's going to just
17:19
lead to Disaster One counterintuitive
17:22
thing here um I think a lot of people
17:24
think oh I'll use the best measure of an
17:27
action which is whether the user is
17:29
paying me dollars this month for my
17:31
product of course that's the best way to
17:33
measure whether they're active and
17:35
counterintuitively this is actually
17:37
often not the case users first stop
17:40
using your product and then they stop
17:43
paying you for your product and I think
17:45
we can all probably relate to this I'm
17:46
sure we each have you know streaming
17:48
services like Netflix or something else
17:51
that we're probably paying for and if
17:53
you think about when the last time you
17:54
watched a show on Netflix it might be
17:56
more than a month ago but you probably
17:58
haven't canceled
17:59
so I would be careful with using just is
18:01
paying as your action a better way to do
18:04
it would be to pair it as is paying and
18:07
is an active user actually used some
18:09
part of my product um this month that's
18:11
a good combination to track so the best
18:14
way to avoid picking too easy in action
18:16
this is the the rubric that I would
18:18
recommend to Founders imagine you're
18:20
sitting next to one of your customers um
18:22
they're here at the table using using
18:24
your product when you watch them use
18:26
your product what is the thing that's
18:28
going through your head that helps you
18:30
answer the question of whether that user
18:32
is a good user of your product that
18:34
they're actually using it in the way
18:35
that you intend whatever that answer is
18:38
I would recommend using that as the
18:40
action in your cohort retention curves
18:42
so another common way to delude yourself
18:45
when you're looking at your cohort
18:46
retention curves is to look at a single
18:48
point in time as opposed to the shape of
18:51
the entire curve um this probably should
18:54
seem obvious but this is a thing that I
18:55
hear from Founders literally every
18:57
single day um I might have a Founder who
19:00
who comes to me and says Dave we're
19:01
doing great we have 80% week-over-week
19:04
retention and um I scratch my head for a
19:07
little bit and then I ask which week um
19:11
what is the 80% what's the numerator and
19:12
what's the denominator in that number
19:14
and almost always the founder doesn't
19:17
know the answer to that question in our
19:19
example we might look one or two months
19:21
out and product a has 75% week three
19:24
retention sounds great but what you
19:27
might want to ask is well what does week
19:29
four retention look like what about week
19:31
two what's the trend line and in our
19:33
example you would find that product A's
19:36
retention is very much not flat and so
19:38
despite having a 75% week three
19:40
retention it's a product that is not
19:42
doing well okay finally just a a word of
19:45
caution about using analytics tools or
19:48
analytics Suites um I think it's awesome
19:50
that they all exist I think it's awesome
19:52
that they have retention and cohort
19:54
retention graphs built in but what I
19:56
would caution you on is that often those
19:59
graphs aren't measuring exactly what you
20:02
think they are I've seen cases where
20:04
these these tools aren't separating
20:06
cohorts in the way that the the founders
20:08
think they are maybe they're measuring
20:10
rolling retention over time as opposed
20:12
to fully separating each cohort
20:15
sometimes they do things like this is a
20:17
graph of whether a user has returned at
20:19
all by a certain date as opposed to
20:22
whether a user returned during this
20:24
specific time period so what I would
20:26
recommend for most Founders is to
20:28
actually build these cohort retention
20:30
curves on your own using your logs via a
20:33
script or in Google Sheets do that a
20:35
little bit upfront yourself to develop
20:38
your own intuition about what's going on
20:40
and how these are actually measured and
20:42
then compare it to what your Analytics
20:44
tool is doing and if they exactly match
20:45
up and you feel really confident then by
20:47
all means use the analytics tools but um
20:50
too many times Founders come to me and
20:52
show me their dashboard and I ask any
20:55
questions about what those numbers
20:56
actually represent and they they don't
20:58
actually know so don't be one of those
21:00
people when you're looking at cohort
21:01
retention curves um you don't need to be
21:04
looking at these multiple times per day
21:06
you don't need to look at them even
21:07
every day but I would recommend at least
21:10
refreshing these graphs every week every
21:12
two weeks uh because when things go
21:15
south um you're going to want to know it
21:17
really quickly far more likely what you
21:19
will find is that your cohort retention
21:21
is not good from the very beginning and
21:24
now we need to think about ways to
21:26
improve it so let's talk about that so
Ways to improve the curve
21:28
the most obvious way is to improve your
21:31
product come up with new use cases maybe
21:33
it should do something completely
21:35
different maybe you need to speed up
21:36
your product or reduce latency somewhere
21:39
make the flows a lot simpler doing all
21:42
of these things actually will change
21:44
your cohort retention curves and you
21:46
will see them get flatter and you will
21:48
also see them get flatter at higher
21:50
levels so in our example that we showed
21:53
earlier if you look at these sets of
21:55
cohorts you might see that the oldest
21:57
cohorts seem to be performing the worst
22:00
they seem to be attracted down to zero
22:04
but then the middle of the year around
22:06
you know July June time frame we see a
22:09
little bit of improvement the cohorts
22:11
are a little bit higher and they're a
22:13
little bit flatter so maybe the team
22:15
behind this product uh made some
22:16
improvements that that made things a lot
22:18
better and then the most recent cohorts
22:20
right October November they seem to be
22:22
flattening out a lot more a lot sooner
22:24
so this is what you might see if you
22:26
actually do make improvements to your
22:28
product that are meaningful so another
22:30
way to improve your your cohort curves
22:32
um is kind of the flip side of improving
22:34
your product is to acquire better users
22:37
I think this is a thing that a lot of
22:38
Founders don't think about often you've
22:41
built a great product but you're
22:43
targeting it to the wrong type of
22:45
customer so you can actually improve
22:47
your performance here by just acquiring
22:50
users in a different way this is
22:52
something that I saw a lot at Google
22:54
working on Google photos I remember at
22:56
one point um some marketing exact High
22:58
up decided that Google needed to Target
23:00
young people more like that was
23:01
important for the company and they did
23:03
this big push on having um marketing and
23:05
advertising targeting gen Z the Gen Z
23:08
audience and so you know the the teams
23:10
at Google are really good they did a
23:11
great job of bringing in a bunch of new
23:14
Young users to use Google photos but it
23:16
turns out those cohorts had really bad
23:19
retention and it kind of makes sense
23:21
like Google photos is a tool to
23:22
accumulate your life's memories and
23:24
reminisce and if you're a young person a
23:27
you don't have that many life memories
23:29
yet and if you do um You probably aren't
23:31
thinking much about like Reminiscing on
23:33
that moment two years ago or one year
23:35
ago you're probably out living your life
23:37
being a young person so this is an
23:39
example of a mismatch between user
23:41
acquisition like who you're trying to
23:42
get to use your product and what your
23:44
product actually does and often this is
23:46
the easiest way to improve the
23:48
performance of your cohorts so we talked
23:51
earlier about when you're picking your
23:52
cohorts um ways that you can slice your
23:56
cohorts you know I talked about by
23:57
country or by device this is a great way
24:01
to try to improve your product and
24:02
figure out like what's going on so if
24:04
you see that your cohort curves are not
24:06
getting flat one of the immediate next
24:09
steps I might recommend is to try to
24:10
slice those cohorts by different
24:12
dimensions you know by what country
24:15
you're serving uh what type of customer
24:17
whether it's a big company or a small
24:19
company that you're targeting in your
24:20
B2B tool divide it up by whatever
24:23
attributes you think make sense and what
24:25
you might find is that some of those
24:27
cohorts are very flat and perform really
24:29
well While others are really really poor
24:32
and that would be a clue of where to to
24:34
start in terms of improving either your
24:36
product or your user acquisition related
24:38
to the idea of acquiring better users
24:41
another way to improve your cohorts is
24:42
to improve the first user experience the
24:45
onboarding the activation of of
24:47
customers that you get this is a thing
24:49
again I think people Overlook they they
24:51
immediately jump to what the product
24:53
does but often you just need to help
24:55
your users get into a good State and and
24:58
be able to use your product in the right
25:00
way we see this a lot with companies
25:01
that are building tools for for
25:03
businesses um they put a lot of time
25:05
into building the tool itself but then
25:07
they don't think about how you actually
25:09
teach people to use it how do you get
25:10
into their workflow what are they doing
25:13
yesterday before they used their product
25:14
and what do you want them to change
25:16
about their life today when they are
25:17
using your product investing in this
25:20
often is like the cheapest and easiest
25:21
way to improve your performance of your
25:23
cohorts okay lastly um a great way to
25:26
improve your cohort retention is to have
25:28
some sort of network effect in your
25:30
product now this won't work for everyone
25:33
but uh products where every subsquent
25:36
user of your product makes the product
25:39
better for your existing users social
25:41
networks um sharing networks texting
25:44
apps these are all examples of that if
25:46
you have a dynamic like that where the
25:48
more people who use it the better it
25:49
gets you should see cohort improvement
25:52
over time as that Network grows and
25:54
becomes more dense so if you're building
25:56
a product that has something like that
25:58
you might want to think about how could
26:00
we focus on building good dense networks
26:03
around the users that we have and you
26:05
may find improvements to your cohorts
26:07
all right finally I want to talk a
26:09
little bit about like what is the Holy
26:10
Grail like what is the best of the best
26:12
look like here and what I would say is
26:15
that the best of the best is cohort
26:17
curves that don't just get flat but they
26:19
actually go up over time and you can do
26:22
this from all of the techniques I just
26:24
talked about making your product better
26:25
targeting better customers um if you do
26:27
this you'll find that you know users of
26:30
your product that are sticking with you
26:32
actually will start using it more and
26:33
more over time and if you see that if
26:35
you're cohort curves are getting flat
26:37
and then increasing and subsequent
26:39
cohorts are getting better and better
26:41
over time you should be feeling really
Conclusion
26:43
good okay so hopefully now you have a
26:46
pretty good idea of actually how to
26:48
measure cohort retention curves and how
26:51
to decide if what you see in those
26:53
curves is good or bad to conclude I kind
26:55
of want to tie this all together and and
26:57
and see how it connects to building a
26:59
really big company so let's go back to
27:02
how we measure the cohorts in the very
27:04
first triangle chart that we looked at
27:05
this is just the count of users from
27:08
each cohort each month who used your
27:10
product in subsequent months what we're
27:12
going to do now is just instead of
27:14
having it be relative months we're going
27:16
to slide all these rows to the other
27:18
side and align them in absolute time so
27:21
now we're seeing all of the users in
27:22
each calendar month which cohort did
27:25
they come from right so let's look at
27:26
December in December here we can see all
27:29
of the users in December are represented
27:31
in the last column in the chart here and
27:33
we can see which cohort they came from
27:35
now let's take this chart but draw it as
27:38
a line graph and this is what we call a
27:42
layer cake chart for every month this is
27:44
the number of users you have of your
27:46
product active users of your product but
27:48
each of the layers of this cake
27:49
represents which cohort they initially
27:51
came from so what you can see here is
27:53
that if you look at the the last month
27:55
in December you know we've now got
27:56
almost 600 users of our product it is
27:59
not just users that we acquired recently
28:01
in December or November it's actually
28:03
composed of all of the previous users
28:05
who stuck with our product and if you
28:07
see a layer cake that looks like this
28:10
that's the top line is growing really
28:11
nicely and it's composed of thick layers
28:14
coming from old cohorts this is like the
28:16
most beautiful chart that you'll ever
28:17
see in your startup so if you see this
28:19
congratulations you're you're Off to the
28:21
Races okay so this layer cake graph um
28:25
is hopefully the start of what could be
28:27
a mult multi-billion dollar company and
28:30
when we think about cohorts I the way I
28:32
talk to Founders about it is you
28:34
obviously want to go talk to your users
28:36
in person hear what they're saying this
28:37
is the qualitative feedback that's going
28:39
to actually give you insights about your
28:41
product a cohort retention curve isn't
28:44
going to teach you what to change
28:46
necessarily but it might tell you
28:48
whether you're on the right track and
28:50
things are working or not and what I
28:52
would say is if you look at your cohort
28:54
retention curves and they don't get flat
28:56
um the one thing you can be sure of is
28:58
that you need to get out there talk to
29:00
your customers understand what's going
29:02
on and hopefully make something that
29:04
they want so thank you so much for
Outro
29:05
spending your time learning about
29:06
cohorts with me I wish for each of you a
29:09
flat cohort retention curve in your
29:11
future
29:14
