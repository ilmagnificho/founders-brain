Co-Founder Equity Mistakes to Avoid  Startup School

In order to get your startup off the ground it's critical to keep your co-founders motivated. One of the best ways to do that is to figure out a fair co-founder equity split. In this episode of Startup School, YC Group Partner Michael Seibel explains the ins and outs of co-founder equity, why it's important to be generous with that equity, and how to avoid bad advice that can lead to co-founder breakups.

0:09
hello I'm Michael cybal and today I'm
0:11
going to talk about co-founder Equity
0:12
splits and co-founder breakups to be
0:15
clear we want people who are building
0:18
tech software startups that they expect
0:20
to be VC funded you know this is advice
0:23
for you I can't really comment on other
0:26
types of businesses there are many types
0:27
of businesses that have that have equity
0:29
and and to be clear this is not really
0:32
about them also this is really focused
0:34
on conversations that Founders are
0:36
having in the beginning of a company for
0:38
pre-product Market fit companies you're
0:40
really talking about the beginning of
0:42
companies all kinds of interesting and
0:43
crazy things happen later on and I it
0:46
would be a misuse of this video and this
0:48
advice to apply to companies that are
0:50
later on or to apply to companies that
0:52
are not tech companies so here's the
0:54
tldr the core advice we want to give is
0:59
be generous
1:00
with co-founder Equity what you're
1:02
trying to do is motivate your founding
1:05
team to work extremely hard when it
1:10
looks for many of the first couple years
1:12
like things are not working the biggest
1:14
mistake is to be stingy on Equity during
1:18
this very very very delicate time in the
1:21
beginning of a startup causing people to
1:24
leave while it's still possible you
1:27
might make something big so the Jedi
1:29
found founder and the dumb founder
1:31
they're both generous with co-founder
1:33
Equity the uh midwit oh they're thinking
1:37
about skill sets and contributions and
1:40
time commitments and the network and
1:42
futurals and D thinking about all of
1:44
these things and trying to do a really
1:46
complicated calculation I'm going to
1:48
argue today that's not required let's go
1:50
over what we're talking about first
1:52
co-funder Equity spits then co-founder
1:55
breakups bad reasons for very unequal
1:58
Equity splits bad advice and then some
2:01
final thoughts all right co-founder
Co-founder equity split
2:04
Equity um in my experience the mistake
2:08
that Founders make is they don't think
2:10
about how to motivate their team their
2:12
founder co-founders today and tomorrow
2:15
typically you're giving people Equity
2:17
over that they're going to earn over the
2:18
course of four years and you don't want
2:22
them to be thinking in year 2 year three
2:25
year four I don't have enough equity I'm
2:28
not motivated or or I have this amount
2:31
of equity and the CEO has four times
2:33
more but I'm grinding every day and I've
2:36
been here since the beginning which
2:38
would create resentment so the job of a
2:41
CEO when Distributing co-founder Equity
2:43
is to not just think about what's going
2:45
to convince your co-founder to work on
2:48
your company today is to think about
2:51
what's going to keep them motivated over
2:52
the course of all four years and
2:55
hopefully much longer in that situation
2:58
our typical advice is to go for close to
3:01
equal Equity splits don't have to be
3:03
exactly equal but the more generous you
3:06
are the more you can expect a strong
3:09
founder to stay motivated
3:11
next vesting and cliffs most often when
3:15
you're giving Founders Equity that
3:17
Equity vests over a period of time which
3:19
means it's earned over a period of time
3:22
and if you
3:23
leave during that period of time you
3:26
don't get all of the equity in addition
3:28
a cliff is essentially designed to say
3:31
if you don't make it to this moment in
3:34
the company's history if you don't make
3:35
it through year one you don't get any of
3:38
your Equity Grant both of those tools
3:41
are extremely valuable and they should
3:44
apply to all founders I have to be
3:47
honest sometimes Founders ask me why are
3:50
we doing this like we all like each
3:52
other we're not going to break up
3:53
nothing's going to go wrong I would just
3:55
say this giving away founder Equity is
3:57
not something that you should be
3:59
innovating on
4:00
and the best practice is that all of
4:03
equity comes with vesting and cliffs
4:05
when it's given to Founders life happens
4:07
crazy happens sometimes people have
4:10
to leave and they don't even want to
4:12
leave sometimes family circumstances
4:14
change sometimes people get sick
4:17
sometimes people don't
4:18
perform so by having vesting and having
4:21
a cliff that gives Founders the ability
4:25
to let other Founders go or for those
4:27
Founders to leave without destroying the
4:30
cap table so you should be using vesting
4:32
in Cliffs what's extremely typical is
4:34
four-year vesting you earn your stock
4:36
over four years and a one-year Cliff you
4:39
don't earn any stock until you've hit
4:42
one year of working at the company NeXT
4:44
your co-founders must be essential to
4:47
your founding team one of the things I
4:49
think about with a founding team is like
4:51
it's the smallest number of people who
4:53
can get an MVP built get it in the hands
4:56
of customers and start learning one of
4:58
the reasons why we tell people one of
5:00
the other reasons why we tell people to
5:01
be generous with their Equity is it
5:03
helps them remove quote unquote
5:05
co-founders who are not essential who
5:08
really shouldn't be on the team or
5:10
perhaps should be employees instead of
5:12
Founders you should understand that like
5:14
the co-founder title is not something
5:16
that should just be given out
5:17
willy-nilly you know teams that come
5:19
into YC with you know five six seven
5:22
co-founders clearly there's something
5:25
weird some conversation hasn't happened
5:27
it's almost always the case seven people
5:30
are not essential to getting a product
5:32
up and out in the hands of customers
5:34
next always remember
5:37
that once again in almost every case
5:39
when you're giving out co-founder Equity
5:42
most of the work in your company hasn't
5:44
been completed so this kind of comes
5:46
back to the first point Equity is about
5:49
motivating people for work they have not
5:52
yet done as opposed to rewarding people
5:54
for work they have done last things
5:56
which are kind of negative one the CEO
5:59
should have have the ability to fire
6:01
Founders who are not performing and so
6:03
however you set up the equity split the
6:05
CEO should Reserve this right and
6:08
honestly there has to be a captain of
6:11
the ship there has to be someone who's
6:13
ultimately held accountable and they
6:16
need to be given the responsibility to
6:18
let people go who aren't performing if
6:21
you're not willing to join a team under
6:23
these
6:25
circumstances that's tricky I would say
6:27
that you're you're not understanding the
6:28
seriousness of a company or maybe you
6:32
should go start a company and be the
6:34
CEO um but the CEO should have this
6:36
responsibility they should um regardless
6:38
of the equity split and then finally
Co-founders break-up
6:40
what's most responsible is if
6:43
co-founders have a conversation about
6:45
what will happen if things don't work
6:47
out now let me give you some guidelines
6:49
at least YC's thoughts on how that
6:51
should go if you have a co-founder
6:54
breakup and you are pre-product Market
6:56
fit here are some guidelines that YC has
6:59
seen work over the years and these are
7:01
things that perhaps you should consider
7:03
talking amongst the co-founders so first
7:06
if a co-founder leaves or is fired
7:10
before their one-year Cliff it's
7:13
extremely typical for them to get just a
7:15
token amount of
7:17
equity 5% to 2% remember this is
7:20
pre-product Market fit so there's no
7:22
evidence that the company is going to
7:24
work and the vast majority of work still
7:27
has has to be done after the onee near
7:29
Cliff but pre-product Market fit we
7:31
recommend that if a Founder leaves or is
7:34
fired they leave with no more than 5% of
7:38
the company which often means they have
7:40
to give back some Equity now this can be
7:43
a tricky conversation but when a
7:45
company's pre-product market fit once
7:47
again so much work is left to be done
7:50
and you want to motivate the people who
7:51
are remaining at the company to
7:53
distribute that Equity to people who can
7:56
actually help continue to increase the
7:59
value of the company employees and
8:00
Founders the founder who's leaving can't
8:03
help increase the value of the company
8:04
anymore so if they're holding a whole
8:06
bunch of equity they're basically
8:07
reducing the chances of the company
8:09
being successful and therefore reducing
8:12
the value of their Equity so that's why
8:14
I recommend if a Founder is leaving or
8:17
is fired after their one-year Cliff they
8:20
should retain no more than 5% of the
8:21
company NeXT if a Founder is fired it's
8:24
extremely reasonable for them to give in
8:26
a small Severance you know 1 to three
8:28
months but if a founder
8:30
leaves that's not typical um you can do
8:33
it but it's not typical and finally
8:36
every founder regardless of whether they
8:37
leave or they're fired should be
8:39
expected to resign from the board sign a
8:41
release um and often give proxy voting
8:44
rights to the founders that are
8:46
remaining basically allowing the
8:47
founders that are remaining to vote
8:49
their shares more often than not it is
8:52
the
8:53
non is a Founder that's not the CEO who
8:56
is going to either leave or be fired but
8:59
I will say this um sometimes it's the
9:01
CEO right life happens and so if that's
9:04
the case whoever the new CEO is has to
9:08
kind of arrange this breakup accordingly
9:12
and even the CEO the previous CEO should
9:15
understand these expectations because
9:17
you know like I said sometimes CEOs
9:19
screw up and they or sometimes CEOs
9:21
choose to leave so with the expectations
9:25
on how equ Equity should be distributed
9:28
and
9:30
um what happens with the breakup let's
9:33
talk about um some cases where we see
9:36
unequal Equity splits that uh let's just
9:40
say don't make any sense the first and
Bad reasons for very unequal equity splits
9:42
most common bad reason for a massively
9:45
unequal Equity split is well my
9:47
co-founder agreed you know I own 90% of
9:50
the company I asked my co-founder if
9:52
they're willing to own 10 they said yes
9:54
so everything's good right I would say
9:56
as a CEO this is a perfect example of
9:59
optimizing for today and not optimizing
10:02
for tomorrow you should be thinking not
10:04
what is your co-founder going to be
10:05
happy with today you should be thinking
10:07
about what's your co-founder going to be
10:08
excited with when it's year three of the
10:10
company and everything sucks what's
10:13
going to keep them motivated to stay and
10:15
work extremely hard then and as CEO you
10:18
always have to be thinking about
10:20
tomorrow regardless of whether your
10:22
co-founder does and you probably should
10:24
be more generous with your Equity to
10:26
compensate for when those bad times are
10:28
happening how do you keep keep that
10:29
co-founder motivated next well I came up
10:32
with the idea so I deserve more Equity
10:34
right it was my idea they're just
10:36
building it we get almost 30,000
10:39
companies apply to YC every six months
10:41
and we see every idea that exists it's
10:44
extremely obvious that ideas are a dime
10:47
a dozen and execution is the game here
10:49
and that co-founder is going to be
10:51
essential in executing the company and
10:53
if they're not they shouldn't be a
10:55
co-founder so I come with an idea is not
10:57
a great reason for a 99010 equity but
10:59
next I started working 6 months before
11:02
my co-founders so I deserve a lot more
11:04
Equity they weren't there at the
11:06
beginning well you still have to ask
11:08
yourself how much work is left to be
11:10
done if this is a traditional tech
11:13
software startup then 99% of the work is
11:15
left to be done this could be a 10 20
11:18
30y year Journey if it's really
11:19
successful and a difference in starting
11:21
date of 6 months probably is not that
11:24
significant when it comes to it next my
11:27
co-founder needs a salary and I don't I
11:29
would argue that you should be thinking
11:30
about salary and Equity differently
11:32
salary is the money that someone needs
11:34
to live to pay their rent to buy food to
11:37
literally give themselves the ability to
11:39
work in your company Equity is what's
11:42
going to motivate them to work extremely
11:44
hard and do extremely well and often get
11:47
a below Market salary so I never like to
11:51
think about reducing someone's Equity
11:55
because they need more salary I always
11:56
like thinking about giving every person
11:59
on the founding team the salary they
12:01
need so they can live for some people
12:03
that might be zero if they come in with
12:04
some money and then giving people the
12:06
equity they need to be motivated to work
12:09
extremely hard all right next I'm older
12:12
and much more experienced than my
12:13
co-founder you know this is a tricky one
12:16
um certainly people who are more
12:18
experienced can contribute to the
12:19
company can help fund raise often there
12:22
are many things they can do that a
12:24
younger less experienced co-founder
12:25
can't but if you're making this person a
12:27
co-founder that means that they're going
12:29
to have to be a key contributor to the
12:31
team that should mean you couldn't do it
12:33
without them so you should be very
12:35
careful about how motivated that
12:37
person's going to be you should be
12:39
generous with Equity as a result next
12:42
well I hired my co-founder after raising
12:44
some
12:44
money well once again you know
12:47
fundraising I think people are surprised
12:49
that fundraising doesn't massively
12:51
change your chances of being successful
12:54
there lots and lots and lots of startups
12:56
that raise money and very few that go on
12:59
to generate a billion dollars in Revenue
13:02
so I would argue that even if you have
13:05
$100,000
13:06
$500,000 in um in investment 99% of the
13:10
work is still left to be done then
13:11
finally I hired my co-founder post
13:13
launch same
13:14
thing that first launch of MVP is just
13:17
the beginning of the journey so to sum
13:20
up I think that all of these answers are
13:24
a flavor of the same thing it's a flavor
13:26
of short-term thinking the best founders
13:29
are long-term thinkers the best Founders
13:32
are not only thinking about today but
13:33
they're thinking about tomorrow and the
13:35
best Founders are thinking about their
13:37
co-founders needs even if those
13:39
co-founders are not thinking about them
13:42
it's the best Founders the best CEOs
13:44
understand that this small team has to
13:45
accomplish a lot or else the whole
13:48
Endeavor isn't going to work the best
13:50
Founders is using Equity to try their
13:52
best to motivate people to work
13:54
extremely hard they're not thinking
13:56
about Equity as something that should be
13:59
hoarded they're thinking about Equity as
14:01
a tool that can produce maximum
14:04
motivation for a small number of people
Common bad advice
14:06
so let's move on to some common uh let's
14:08
say bad advice that I see right so if
14:11
our advice ISS hey you should be
14:13
generous with your co-founder Equity um
14:15
you want to motivate people for the long
14:16
term and you should protect yourself by
14:19
have investing in Cliffs some bad advice
14:21
that I see is like oh we should have
14:23
performance-based Equity um you know if
14:26
my CTO writes this number of lines of
14:28
code or if my you know if the founder
14:31
that's doing sales like generates a
14:33
million dollars in Revenue will set
14:36
their Equity based on that needless to
14:37
say at the beginning of the Journey of a
14:40
tech startup it's really unclear how to
14:43
set those types of goals um and those
14:46
goals change we see companies pivoting
14:49
and thinking that you can kind of
14:50
measure things so precisely at the start
14:52
is a really big fallacy furthermore uh
14:56
this is probably not an area that you
14:58
should be innovating should innovating
15:01
on your product and how you interact
15:02
with your customers um Distributing
15:04
Equity there are best practices that
15:06
tend to work so that's why Performance
15:09
Based Equity is not something I would
15:11
consider well what about part-time
15:12
Founders um I would argue that a
15:15
part-time founder isn't a founder and
15:18
shouldn't really be considered in this
15:20
equation I know there are some edge
15:22
cases where there are some part-time
15:24
Founders or like you know people who
15:26
swop in and swop out and y y y but I
15:29
think if you look at the most viable
15:31
companies in the world you don't see a
15:33
lot of prevalence of part-time Founders
15:36
so I just don't think they should be
15:37
considered if you want to be a Founder
15:38
you should be working full-time and then
15:40
like what about other kinds of like
15:41
Dynamic Equity agreements like oh if the
15:44
company accomplishes this or if y y
15:46
happens and like the equity is not
15:49
really set if you're trying to motivate
15:51
people it's really nice for them to know
15:53
what they have and especially Founders
15:57
they're going to be a lot lot more
15:59
motivated if they know what they have
16:01
when they're starting versus some weird
16:04
kind of thing that's like hard to Define
16:06
in the rules might change Etc so I think
16:09
you know these options are too fancy and
16:13
oral advised often times they're created
16:16
because people don't understand the
16:17
value of vesting in a cliff if founder
16:21
relationship isn't working out that
16:23
founder should leave or be fired and
16:26
that should happen before the cliff
16:29
that's your protection that's your
16:30
protection if things aren't working out
16:32
not fancy formulas and weird kind of
16:37
madeup stuff and to be honest if you
16:40
don't have
16:42
the
16:43
wherewithal to ask a co-founder to leave
16:46
if they're not performing or as a
16:49
co-founder if you realize that you're
16:51
not able to perform if you don't have
16:53
the wherewithal to leave on your own
16:55
accord you shouldn't be doing this like
16:57
you're not respecting how hard this is
17:00
and how much work your co-founders are
17:01
putting into it that's why vesting
17:03
Cliffs work that's your downside
17:05
protection and that gives you the
17:07
ability to be generous with your Equity
17:10
um as opposed to create fancy schemes so
Final thoughts
17:14
to wrap up um one common thing that you
17:18
see among successful companies is that
17:21
over the long term over 10 over 15 years
17:24
um one founder will often stick with the
17:26
company a lot longer be more responsible
17:30
uh for a lot longer and you could argue
17:34
was more valuable to the company right
17:37
you know you see these famous companies
17:38
like Amazon and Jeff Bezos or uh Mark
17:42
Zuckerberg at Facebook etc etc that's
17:46
true and you would think that that means
17:49
that those
17:50
people should deserve vastly more Equity
17:54
than their co-founders who might not
17:56
have stuck around for you know a decade
17:59
Etc here's the tricky bit about that it
18:02
turns out with tech startups the
18:05
beginning is extremely important those
18:08
first four to six years is where a lot
18:12
of value is being created and those
18:14
first four to six years is when most
18:15
companies
18:17
die so I would argue that even if you're
18:21
in this lucky situation of your company
18:24
being massively successful and you know
18:26
you being the one who stays around the
18:27
longest you still want to be extremely
18:30
generous with co-founder Equity because
18:32
those co-founders actually got you the
18:35
energy of activation your company needed
18:38
to even be in the game and without them
18:43
maybe you're not in the game at all and
18:44
you don't get to see this company scale
18:46
to something great you should really
18:50
understand how important the early years
18:53
are and the co-founders are and
18:55
co-founder motivation is to making
18:58
successful products happen and you
19:00
should use your co-founder Equity to
19:04
give yourself the best chance of
19:07
building something that people want
19:09
after
19:10
that hey man you're Off to the Races
19:13
you're doing better than 99% of other
19:14
startups and of course the rules change
