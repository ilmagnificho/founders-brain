How To Price For B2B  Startup School

If you're a startup founder, how much should you charge for your product or service? It's a simple question that can make many lock up. What number should you pick? In this episode of Startup School, YC Group Partner Tom Blomfield guides you on how to come up with a price and then justify that number to customers.

Intro
0:01
[Music]
0:09
hi there my name is Tom and I'm a
0:11
partner here at y combinator today I'm
0:14
going to be talking about one of the
0:15
most common questions I get from
0:17
Founders which is how to price so the
0:20
Founder's been working on outbound sales
0:22
contacting people and they finally had a
0:24
sales call that went really really well
0:26
the champion that's the person the
0:28
customer who's uh potentially buying is
0:31
really really interested in in the
0:32
product and asked us for pricing and we
0:35
just froze what number should we pick
0:38
often when you haven't worked at a big
0:40
company you don't have good calibration
0:43
about what kind of prices these
0:45
companies tend to pay for software and
0:47
so you might think of the last time you
0:49
bought software you know a subscription
0:50
to GitHub or chat GPT and you pick a
0:54
ludicrously no low number $19 a month or
0:57
$49 a month or something like that
0:59
because for Founders who have spent the
1:02
last two or three months building a
1:03
product asking for tens or even hundreds
1:06
of thousands of dollars can feel very
1:08
uncomfortable you almost can't say it
1:10
with a straight face and so what I'm
1:13
going to talk about today is a way to to
1:16
come up with a price and justify that
1:18
price to your customer so there are
The Value Equation
1:19
three core elements here and by far the
1:23
most important is what I call the value
1:25
equation so this is the idea that you
1:28
sit down uh with your with your Champion
1:30
that's the person at the customer that's
1:32
really into your product that perhaps
1:34
sees it's going to solve one of their
1:35
biggest problems and you write down with
1:38
this Champion uh what they expect your
1:41
product to do for them what value it's
1:43
going to deliver uh to their company
1:45
that might be a cost saving it might be
1:47
a time saving or an increase in revenue
1:49
and you've got to write this down step
1:51
by step and then get the customer to
1:53
challenge it to produ it and really make
1:55
sure the assumptions are correct because
1:57
ultimately it's a tool for that person
1:59
to take to their boss or their CFO to
2:02
justify the purchase of this contract so
2:04
we're going to walk through a quick
2:05
example here say you're selling a I
2:09
don't know a customer service tool to a
2:11
big company that has a c 100 customer
2:13
support agents and maybe just for the
2:16
sake of argument uh each customer
2:18
support agent is paid $50,000 a year in
2:21
salaries and then there's another
2:22
$50,000 uh per employee in additional
2:25
costs that might be offices overheads
2:28
health insurance all that stuff so so
2:30
the fully loaded cost of each customer
2:32
service person is
2:33
$100,000 and they've got a hundred of
2:35
them so that's $10 million of total
2:38
customer service cost and say we're
2:40
going in to this customer saying we've
2:42
got this new AI powered customer service
2:44
tool that will eliminate 20% of the
2:47
queries or 20% of the total time spent
2:50
by that customer service team that's $2
2:52
million of potential cost saving and so
2:55
again remember you're normally saving
2:57
time which is cost or reducing cost
2:59
directly or increasing Revenue those are
3:01
typically the three things that
3:02
companies care about so once you've
3:05
established what value you're delivering
3:08
the pricing is pretty simple I typically
3:10
pick somewhere between 25 and 50% of the
3:13
value you're delivering so they keep
3:16
roughly 2/3 you keep roughly a third so
3:19
our previous example $2 million of
3:21
savings uh they keep 1.3 you charge them
3:25
maybe 700k something like that and it's
3:27
a great deal for both of you this person
3:29
take it to their CFO and show really
3:32
good return on investment so the great
3:34
thing about this value equation is it
3:36
also gives you the success metrics that
3:38
you need to prove during a pilot project
3:41
so you might go to the customer and say
3:43
let's try this tool for a month with
3:45
with just a portion of your team maybe
3:47
let's get 10 customer service agents to
3:48
try it out and see if it actually does
3:51
reduce queries and let's measure it and
3:53
as long as it reduces queries by 20% or
3:56
saves the customer service agents at
3:57
least 20% of the time we know this value
4:00
equation holds and if the metrics come
4:01
back slightly different maybe it only
4:03
saves 15% or it does really well and
4:05
saves 25% you can even adjust the
4:07
pricing based on that but the value
4:09
equation tells you the the success
4:12
metrics that you need to prove during a
4:14
pilot process so that's the first part
4:16
of pricing and by far it's the most
4:19
important if you just stop with that
4:21
value equation honestly you'll get 80 or
4:23
90% of of the pricing spawn on but there
4:25
are a couple of other elements it's
4:27
usually useful to consider the first of
Cost
4:29
those is cost what does it cost you to
4:32
provide this service to the customer
4:35
it's important you never start with cost
4:37
some people like to do a cost plus a
4:39
margin pricing and it just always ends
4:41
up with you underpricing your software
4:44
cost should only ever be a floor so you
4:46
you do your value equation you take a
4:48
third of it um that comes out to
4:50
$700,000 perhaps your costs are mainly
4:53
open AI fees or something like that and
4:55
AWS fees and that comes to something
4:56
like
4:58
$200,000 so $700 K is your contract
5:00
value 200k is your cost you're golden if
5:03
however you've come up with a value
5:05
equation and and your share of it which
5:07
only comes in at 150k and your cost a
5:10
200k you're in a bad business know
5:13
you'll have to price at below your cost
5:15
which is not sustainable and so you're
5:18
either going to have to figure out um
5:19
how to demonstrate more value or change
5:22
what you're building ultimately or get
5:23
out of the business entirely really you
5:25
should be aiming for software margins of
5:27
like 80 or 90%
5:29
note on uh credits so people AWS
5:33
Microsoft open AI giving out tons and
5:35
tons of credits to startups you should
5:37
treat those as a cash cost don't assume
5:40
you'll have unlimited credits forever
5:42
it'll totally mess up your margins there
5:44
are occasionally situations where you
5:46
might want to price at or even below
5:49
cost but it's a really really risky
5:52
maneuver typically used by Founders who
5:54
want to grab market share in a in a you
5:55
know in an arms race it's a land grab
5:58
situation it's very very dangerous
6:00
you're really betting that the costs are
6:01
going to come down dramatically in
6:03
future although having said that with
6:05
the development of llms um companies
6:07
like open Ai and anthropic do keep
6:09
dramatically reducing costs so there's
6:12
perhaps some argument that you might
6:13
want to price a little bit lower now
6:15
because you know your margins are going
6:16
to improve with time but honestly it's a
6:19
really risky maneuver and I would advise
6:21
startups to to really try to keep to
6:23
that 80 or 90% uh gross margin so the
Competition
6:26
third element in pricing is competition
6:30
so you've done your value equation
6:31
you've calculated about a third of that
6:33
you've checked that your costs are way
6:35
way below that so you're sustaining a
6:36
sort of 8 90% Marin you're in good shape
6:38
but you have a direct competitor who's
6:41
just entered the market and uh their
6:44
software is equivalent to yours and
6:45
they've decided to underprice you by
6:47
half what do you do this is really
6:50
really tricky a Founder's um first
6:53
response is to often just engage in a
6:55
price War so to take the price that your
6:58
competitors's offered and then just
6:59
undercut them the problem is they'll do
7:01
the same undercut you and that you'll
7:03
undercut them again and it's just a race
7:05
to the bottom so competing solely on
7:08
pricing really is not a winning maneuver
7:10
you don't want to get into a
7:12
head-to-head bidding war for a commodity
7:14
product instead what you want to do is
7:16
set your product apart based on
7:19
functionality or value it can't be an
7:21
apples for apples comparison your
7:24
product needs to be differentiated if
7:26
there's extreme competition in an
7:28
industry for a commodity product that's
7:30
a product where they're all basically
7:31
the same all the margin gets driven out
7:34
so you take the airline industry as an
7:36
example basically commodity taking a a
7:39
seat in an airplane um across the
7:41
country the airline industry on average
7:42
has 2.7% net profit margin it's a brutal
7:46
brutal business and airlines are on the
7:47
brink of going bus the whole time
7:50
because they're just struggling to
7:51
differentiate so now we've talked about
7:53
the three main elements starting with
7:55
the value equation considering your cost
7:57
and competition we're going to talk
7:58
about other techniques for determining
8:01
the price or maybe even the pricing
8:03
structure so another question you want
8:04
to ask uh your Champion is how and what
8:07
do they pay for other similar software
8:09
products for example are they used to
8:12
paying a monthly flat fee or per sey
8:15
pricing or usage bands or credits I
8:17
would really explore the industry you're
8:19
selling into and understand what they're
8:21
used to paying and and the way they're
8:23
used to structuring pricing and then
8:25
pick a pricing strategy they're used to
8:27
people typically are wary of totally
8:30
uncapped usage based pricing so you
8:32
might want to put a cap on that and
8:34
really if you can mirror the way they
8:36
are used to paying for other software
8:38
the better you'll do overwhelmingly
8:40
though when you're choosing pricing it's
8:42
important to keep it simple over
8:44
complicating pricing will kill a sales
8:47
process in general committed recurring
8:50
Revenue that's monthly recurring revenue
8:52
or annual recurring revenue is
8:53
preferable to usage based pricing and
8:56
that's because during an economic
8:58
downturn or a Slowdown
9:00
your revenue is protected at least until
9:02
the contract is up for Renewal and then
9:04
you can have a debate with the customer
9:05
about whether it's worth renewing
9:07
whereas if it's pure usage based Revenue
9:09
there's a real risk that your Revenue
9:10
just falls off a cliff in a in a bad
9:12
month and investors are really worryed
9:14
about that so if you can uh aim for Mr
9:17
or even ARR one technique to do this is
9:21
to start with usage based pricing for
9:23
new customers um run the the the
9:27
contract for a month or two and see what
9:29
usage is and then offer to move them to
9:31
a minimum monthly commitment uh with
9:34
volume discounts so you can see they're
9:35
using on average $15,000 a month offer
9:38
them a 12,000 a month flat fee which
9:41
includes all their usage if they commit
9:43
to a 12-month contract another technique
9:46
is to ask your Champion what amount
9:49
they're able to personally sign off
9:51
without having to get additional
9:52
approvals from the CFO or the legal team
9:55
so maybe have they have signing
9:57
authority of up to $15,000
9:59
that's a good hint that you should keep
10:01
your Pilot pricing to maybe
10:04
$149.99 something like that just to keep
10:06
it moving really really quickly next I
Pricing
10:08
want to talk about whether you should
10:10
publish your prices on your website or
10:12
have a contact sales for Enterprise
10:14
pricing there are strong feelings about
10:16
this on the internet and often software
10:18
developers say I just want to see the
10:19
price I just want to click a button and
10:21
put my credit card into bio I hate
10:23
talking to sales why do I have to talk
10:24
to sales the problem is the value
10:27
equation is going to be different for
10:29
each Enterprise customer that's why most
10:31
Enterprise plans say contact sales if
10:34
you choose a price randomly and put it
10:36
on your website for an Enterprise
10:37
contract you are certainly leaving money
10:40
on the table you'll overprice the
10:42
product for a whole chunk of customers
10:44
who don't get that much value out of it
10:45
so you've lost them entirely and for the
10:47
people who get much more value out of it
10:49
you're underpricing it for that segment
10:51
dramatically so typically what companies
10:54
do is have one or two cheaper plans
10:56
perhaps an individual plan and a small
10:58
team or startup plan that contains most
11:01
of the basic functionality but excludes
11:03
the core functionality that enterprises
11:06
really really want so you can go and
11:07
look at other SAS company pricing pages
11:09
and see what they gate behind Enterprise
11:11
plans often it's things like uh sock 2
11:14
audit reports or single sign on or audit
11:17
logs or compliance reports or data being
11:20
kept in certain geographies things like
11:21
that uh that really individuals and
11:23
small companies don't really care about
11:25
and Enterprises find absolutely vital
11:28
and can't live without that allows you
11:30
to um to price differently for your
11:32
small customers and your Enterprise
11:33
customers sometimes up to 10 times more
11:36
for Enterprise customers for these um
11:38
extra compliance legal data privacy
11:41
kinds of features the next thing we
11:42
should talk about is understanding that
11:45
your pricing strategy dictates your
11:48
sales channels but differently at this
11:51
pricing level is there enough money in
11:54
each contract to compensate a sales team
11:56
or account Executives so a good rule of
11:59
thumb is about a 5:1 ratio between new
12:04
signed ARR and total compensation for a
12:07
salesperson including commission so for
12:10
example if you you pay a salesperson
12:13
$100,000 a year in annual compensation
12:16
including their base salary plus uh any
12:19
sales commission so 100,000 total
12:21
compensation you might reasonably expect
12:23
that salesperson to close $500,000 of
12:26
new AR every year but $500,000 of new AR
12:30
can can be split down in so many
12:32
different ways is that
12:34
$500,000 contracts in which case each
12:37
account executive is really they're
12:39
hunting whales they're trying to close a
12:41
contract every couple of months
12:43
something like that and they might might
12:45
only be working on four five six
12:47
contracts at a time or is it 20 time
12:50
$25,000 contracts so $25,000 annual
12:54
contract about $22,000 a month and your
12:56
account Executives would need to close
12:58
about two of those per month just under
13:00
two to meet 20 per year to get to that
13:03
$500,000 contract still doable or are
13:06
you tasking them with closing
13:09
$500,000 annual contracts every year so
13:12
that last example $1,000 annually is
13:15
about $83 a month your sales rep has to
13:17
clo close 42 deals every month that's
13:21
almost two every single working day
13:23
that's not really a true account
13:24
executive or outbound sales team at best
13:27
you might have a call center of inside
13:29
sales so they're basically picking up
13:30
the phone when someone wants to buy and
13:32
you know typing stuff into a a computer
13:34
system and answering questions it's not
13:36
they're not out hunting whales anymore
13:38
they're really sort of harvesting a you
13:40
know a field of wheat or something the
13:41
next subject I want to talk about is
Free trials
13:43
whether you should offer free trials or
13:46
pilots in general offering a really long
13:49
free trial or a pilot is
13:52
counterproductive uh the customer not
13:54
actually bought into using the product
13:56
and so what you want to do is keep these
13:57
these Pilots or these proof Concepts
13:59
really really short maybe a couple of
14:01
weeks maybe four weeks with really
14:04
really clear success criteria from what
14:06
we talked about earlier with the the
14:07
value equation a better technique if
14:10
you're really confident is to push your
14:12
customers to sign up for an annual
14:14
contract from the very start but with a
14:17
30-day or 60-day money back guarantee
14:20
and opt out at the start so if it
14:21
doesn't deliver what they want they can
14:22
get their money back no questions asked
14:24
but by default it becomes a recurring
14:27
contract You Can Count this as recurring
14:29
Revenue pretty much straight away
14:31
another question I get is we just a two
14:33
or three person startup should we uh you
14:35
know um put up more people on our
14:37
website or uh sign more people up to our
14:39
LinkedIn company account to act like
14:41
we're a much much bigger company to try
14:43
and close these customers in general no
14:46
that's not a good idea what you should
14:47
do instead is play to your strengths as
14:49
a startup say to your customers you can
14:52
have the phone number of the founders
14:54
and we're on call 24/7 to come and fix
14:57
your problems you're certainly not going
14:58
to going to get that from Salesforce or
15:01
Oracle or something like that so play
15:03
into your strengths as a startup okay in
15:06
conclusion if you really really don't
15:08
know how to price you've tried the value
15:10
equation it's it's just not worked you
15:12
just it's too uncertain somehow honestly
15:15
just pick a number that's similar to
15:17
other kinds of software that your
15:18
customers buy and then what I would do
15:21
is increase that number by 50% for every
15:24
time you pitch a new customer so you
15:26
start at 10,000 and they say yes and the
15:28
next customer you going 15 and the next
15:29
customer maybe you get a
15:31
22,000 and when you start to lose more
15:34
than 25% of potential deals base solely
15:37
on price you're now probably in the
15:39
right ballp so you don't need to win
15:41
every single deal and if every single
15:43
deal is closing straight away you're
15:45
almost certainly underpricing and just
15:48
remember if your company is successful
15:50
these initial 5 10 customers you sign up
15:53
at the start are going to be a tiny tiny
15:54
fraction of the revenue you make over
15:56
the next 5 years and so it's more
15:59
important to start signing deals and
16:01
getting to the flow of it you can always
16:02
increase prices as the product improves
16:04
you add new modules and put them behind
16:06
a payall or upsell customers so over
16:09
optimizing for pricing early is a big
16:11
mistake pick a number try and sell it
16:14
and and just experiment As you move on
16:16
it gets easier and easier to close
16:18
customers and increase prices as the
16:20
company grows because you presumably are
16:22
getting better at sales over time you're
16:24
getting validation logos on your
16:26
homepage of all of the happy customers
16:28
who you're using your product and unless
16:30
you're doing something really wrong your
16:32
product should be improving dramatically
16:34
over time the first two or three sales
16:37
are normally the absolute hardest you'll
16:39
ever have to do uh so just get them
16:41
closed so to recap there are three
Recap
16:44
really really important parts to any
16:46
pricing first is the value equation
16:50
write it down get your Champion to
16:52
challenge it and then price at about a
16:54
third of the value you're delivering so
16:56
the customer keeps 2third of the value
16:58
you keep one third second consider cost
17:02
make sure you're not pricing at or below
17:05
cost unless you've got a really really
17:07
good plan to dramatically reduce costs
17:09
in the short to medium term and then
17:11
thirdly if there's competition in the
17:13
space you could get into a pricing war
17:15
