Intro
0:01
[Music]
0:09
my name is Pete Kuman I'm a group
0:11
partner at YC and a YC Alum I was
0:14
co-founder and CTO of optimis Le in the
0:16
winter 2010 batch in this talk I'm going
0:19
to walk step by step through the process
0:21
of closing your first Enterprise
0:23
customers I'm going to do that by
0:24
focusing on successive steps in the
0:26
sales funnel prospecting Outreach
0:30
qualification pricing closing and
0:33
implementation I'll do my best to
0:35
include lots of tactical advice and
0:37
counterintuitive lessons I picked up
0:39
while I was learning how to sell at
0:41
optimiz Le I'm going to focus on
0:43
Enterprise sales for software startups
0:46
but this talk should still be broadly
0:47
useful to any founder getting started
0:49
with sales regardless of the size of
0:51
your customers or what you're selling
0:53
why am I giving this talk well first I
0:56
know there's demand for this sales is
0:58
the number one concern during the the
1:00
batch for most of the founders that I
1:01
work with at YC second I know from
1:05
experience that sales is a learnable
1:07
skill my co-founder Dan and I both had
1:10
technical backgrounds we knew how to
1:12
build a product but we didn't know how
1:14
to get people to use it we figured it
1:16
out through trial and error and that's
1:19
the first big lesson I want to impart
1:21
today if you're the founder of an early
1:24
stage startup and you're building a
1:26
product that you're hoping other
1:27
businesses will buy you are capable of
1:30
selling it that's the good news the bad
1:32
news is that you're probably the only
1:35
person capable of selling your product
1:37
that is if you aren't able to sell your
1:39
product yourself at first chances are
1:41
you're not going to be able to hire
1:43
somebody else to do it for you now if
1:45
you're anything like we were you're
1:47
probably thinking there are lots of
1:49
talented salespeople out there wouldn't
1:51
it be faster to hire one of them than
1:53
try to do it ourselves after all that's
1:55
what youd probably do with any other
1:56
role like designers or lawyers or
1:59
accountants the problem is that sales
2:01
before you find product Market fit is
2:03
very different from sales after you find
2:06
product Market fit sales pre pmf is
2:08
fundamentally entrepreneurial it
2:10
requires vision and credibility with
2:13
customers and lots of experimentation
2:15
and a tight feedback loop with the
2:17
people building the product this is a
2:19
role for Founders so does that mean if
2:21
you're a team of technical Founders
2:23
building a product you should go find a
2:25
business co-founder to do sales well you
2:28
probably don't need a business
2:29
co-founder to sell either I've worked
2:32
with many technical Founders who turned
2:33
out to be great at selling in some cases
2:36
very much to their surprise so why is
2:39
that well if you're a technical founder
2:41
building a product you have several
2:43
advantages that will give you a big leg
2:45
up in selling first you're an expert
2:48
both in the problem you're solving and
2:50
the product you're building and second
2:52
you have conviction you sincerely
2:55
believe that your product will solve
2:57
your customer's problem expertise and
3:00
conviction are surprisingly important in
3:02
sales this is especially surprising to
3:04
people who mistakenly think that selling
3:07
is a dark art full of psychological
3:09
tricks sales isn't about tricking people
3:12
it's fundamentally about helping people
3:14
solve their problems and Engineers are
3:17
great at doing that anyway now that I've
3:20
hopefully convinced you that you're
3:21
capable of selling your product let's
3:23
talk about how to do that like I said
3:25
we're going to go through the step in a
3:27
typical sales funnel together let's
Prospecting
3:29
start with prospecting prospecting means
3:31
finding potential customers the output
3:35
of this step is a list of companies you
3:37
think might need your product and the
3:39
specific humans at those companies you
3:41
think might buy it there are lots of
3:43
tools you can use for prospecting but
3:45
before you start you need a hypothesis a
3:48
sales hypothesis goes something like
3:50
this customer X has problem Y and our
3:54
product will help them solve it a good
3:56
hypothesis makes prospecting Easy by
3:58
clarifying who you should be talking to
4:01
for example at optimizely our initial
4:04
hypothesis was something like this
4:06
marketers at small and medium Tech media
4:10
and e-commerce companies want to run AB
4:12
tests on their websites but they can't
4:15
because off-the-shelf experimentation
4:17
tools require users to write code
4:19
optimizely will enable them to run AB
4:22
tests without writing code and once you
4:24
have a clear hypothesis like that you
4:26
can get to work on prospecting start by
4:29
identif identifying companies that are
4:30
likely to suffer from the problem you're
4:33
solving one way to do this is to buy
4:35
industry lists of all of the companies
4:37
in a given sector and then use some
4:39
filtering criteria to qualify those
4:42
companies and narrow your target list
4:44
for example at optimizely we used a tool
4:47
called builtwith to figure out whether
4:50
prospects were using analytics tools and
4:52
JavaScript Frameworks because those were
4:54
signals that a company was relatively
4:56
sophisticated and cared about their
4:58
website once you have list of companies
5:00
you'll need to find the right humans at
5:03
those companies and their contact
5:04
information there are tools that make
5:06
this easier this video was recorded
5:09
during the winter 24 batch and many
5:11
Founders in the current batch are using
5:12
Apollo and Linkedin sales navigator for
Outreach
5:15
that now that you have a list of leads
5:17
that is specific humans that are likely
5:19
to buy at the companies you're selling
5:21
to you'll need to get their attention
5:23
this step is called Outreach the goal of
5:26
Outreach is usually to schedule a
5:28
meeting with your prospect most Founders
5:30
think of cold Outreach as the primary
5:32
mechanism for doing this but the easiest
5:35
way to get a meeting with a prospect is
5:36
to get them to reach out to you even if
5:38
you're planning on using a sales Le
5:40
approach you should still do everything
5:42
you can to generate inbound demand
5:45
launch early and often create technical
5:48
content like videos and blog posts that
5:51
prospects can find while searching for a
5:53
solution to their problem build
5:54
self-served demos that people can share
5:57
find online forums where your customers
5:59
hang out and establish yourself as an
6:01
expert by answering questions there's no
6:04
one way to do this but the better you
6:06
get at grabbing your customers attention
6:08
and getting them to reach out to you the
6:10
more efficient your sales process will
6:12
be on that note if your customers all
6:15
hang out and Industry conferences you
6:17
should be there too find a way to get a
6:19
list of attendees ahead of time and set
6:21
up lots of meetings in advance once
6:23
you've identified a specific Prospect
6:25
you want to talk to start by trying to
6:27
find a warm introduction if you can look
6:30
on LinkedIn for shared connections and
6:32
ask for an intro sending cold emails is
6:35
usually the least efficient way of
6:36
getting prospects attention but it can
6:38
still be effective if you approach it
6:40
the right way start by writing each
6:42
email by hand make your emails short and
6:45
to the point and make the ask clear you
6:48
should also make it clear why you're
6:50
reaching out to each recipient
6:51
specifically humans have built-in spam
6:54
filters and if your email looks like it
6:56
was sent to thousands of people it's
6:58
going to get deleted on this last Point
7:00
there's a handy rule of thumb to keep in
7:02
mind for cold emails only send emails
7:04
that you yourself would be excited to
7:06
read if you wouldn't be excited to get
7:08
the email you're about to send your
7:10
prospect probably won't either before we
7:13
move on I want to spend some time
7:15
talking about a particular anti-pattern
7:17
I see with a lot of YC Founders many
7:19
Founders start by talking to anyone who
7:22
will take their call and the problem
7:23
with this approach is that it selects
7:25
for the people who are easiest to talk
7:27
to not the people who will be be great
7:30
customers so if you're not disciplined
7:31
about it you'll end up wasting all your
7:33
time chasing bad customers that are easy
7:36
to talk to I see YC Founders make this
7:38
mistake all the time and I get it when
7:41
you're starting a company it's hard to
7:42
get people to pay attention to you cold
7:45
emailing is a demoralizing grind so it's
7:48
tempting to go after the people who will
7:50
talk to you even if they won't ever buy
7:52
your product and the reason this mistake
7:54
is so dangerous is because talking to
7:56
bad customers gives you the illusion
7:59
that you're making progress when you're
8:00
not you'll get lotss of great product
8:02
feedback from people who think they're
8:04
doing you a favor but because you're not
8:06
actually talking to someone who needs
8:07
your product this kind of feedback is
8:09
useless at best and counterproductive at
8:12
worst in practice I see Founders make
8:14
this mistake in two ways first by trying
8:18
to sell enterprise software to startups
8:21
now if your product solves a problem
8:23
that companies only have when they get
8:25
big like for example an HR information
8:28
system then trying to sell it to
8:29
startups is a waste of time but Founders
8:32
still do it all the time because other
8:34
startups are much easier to talk to than
8:36
busy big company Executives and the
8:39
second is trying to go bottom up with a
8:42
product that needs to be adopted top
8:45
down and that's a little jargony so let
8:47
me illustrate it with an example imagine
8:49
you're building productivity software
8:51
like notion your product can be adopted
8:54
bottom up meaning that individual
8:55
employees or teams can start using it
8:58
independently without having to
8:59
coordinate with anyone else inside the
9:01
company and in this case talking to
9:04
individual contributors or their direct
9:06
managers is totally fine but what if
9:08
you're building building software for
9:10
large hospitals in order for a hospital
9:12
to start using your product you're going
9:14
to need a lot of different teams to
9:16
coordinate with each other so you might
9:18
need the CIO to sign off on your
9:20
security and compliance and you need
9:22
their software team to integrate your
9:25
product with their in-house systems you
9:27
need the doctors to enter billing codes
9:29
at after each appointment and you need
9:31
their Ops Team to manage Collections and
9:33
so on and so on and in this case talking
9:35
to an individual doctor won't be useful
9:37
you need to talk to a senior leader like
9:39
a CFO or a CIO to do a deal now there's
9:43
a meme that YC says you should sell to
9:46
companies who will buy quickly even if
9:48
they aren't good customers this is a
9:51
misconception you should try to find
9:53
companies that will buy quickly but you
9:55
shouldn't spend time trying to sell to
9:57
companies that don't actually need your
9:58
product or won't be good customers you
10:01
need to find people who have the problem
10:03
you're solving and the budget and
10:05
decision-making authority to buy your
10:07
product we'll spend more time on this
Qualification
10:09
point later let's get back to our sales
10:10
funnel so you've managed to get your
10:13
prospect on the phone your job on the
10:14
first call is not to sell your product
10:18
that comes later in the first call we're
10:20
just trying to do two things first we're
10:23
trying to qualify our Prospect by
10:26
figuring out whether they have the
10:27
problem we're trying to solve and the
10:29
budget and decision-making authority to
10:31
buy the product and second we're trying
10:34
to schedule a follow-up call for a
10:36
product demo now many Founders face
10:38
plant in the first call by diving
10:40
straight into their pitch these Founders
10:42
are making one of the biggest founder
10:44
sales mistakes not asking enough
10:46
questions and they make this mistake
10:48
because they misunderstand how sales
10:51
work they think of the company they're
10:53
trying to sell to as a big monolithic
10:56
entity and they think of the sales
10:57
process as adversar
10:59
where it's their job to come up with a
11:01
perfect pitch that will break down their
11:03
targets defenses but outside of some
11:05
used car dealerships that's not how
11:08
sales works in the real world in the
11:10
real world you're almost always selling
11:12
to an individual human not a big
11:15
monolithic entity and that's good news
11:17
because humans are easier to understand
11:19
than organizations and that turns out to
11:21
be really important in the real world
11:24
sales is not adversarial it's about
11:26
deeply understanding a customer's
11:28
problem and help helping them solve it
11:30
and great salespeople spend most of
11:32
their time listening because that's the
11:35
best way to understand someone's problem
11:37
they ask all sorts of questions what
11:39
made you decide to take this call tell
11:41
me about this problem how long have you
11:43
had it how bad is it who else does it
11:46
affect how do you quantify the impact
11:49
why haven't you solved it already what's
11:51
your budget for solving it how does your
11:54
organization buy software who makes the
11:57
buying decision who else will need to
11:59
weigh in on this decision now sometimes
12:02
when you ask questions like these you
12:04
discover that your prospect doesn't
12:05
actually have the problem you're trying
12:07
to solve or they have it but they don't
12:10
care enough about it to buy a solution
12:12
or they don't have any budget or any
12:13
number of other reasons that they won't
12:16
actually be a good customer for you and
12:18
if you do that that's great you just
12:20
saved yourself and your prospect a lot
12:22
of time and you can focus your energy on
12:25
other prospects that are more likely to
12:26
buy now if on the other hand it turns
12:29
out that your prospect does have a
12:31
problem you can solve you're in luck
12:33
you've earned the opportunity to show
12:35
them how your product works the next
12:37
step is a demo most Founders think of a
12:40
demo as a chance to finally show off
12:42
their product in my experience thinking
12:45
about it this way is a Surefire way to
12:47
deliver a bad demo that's because your
12:50
job in a demo is not to show off your
12:53
product it's to convince your audience
12:55
that you can help them solve their
12:57
problem and one helpful trick I've
12:59
learned is to think of your demo as the
13:01
script for a great movie a great script
13:03
always starts with a recap of who the
13:06
main character is that's your user and
13:09
the problem she's trying to solve this
13:11
is your chance to demonstrate how well
13:13
you were listening during your first
13:14
call if your audience believes you
13:17
understand their company and their
13:18
problems they're going to take you
13:20
seriously when you talk about how to
13:21
solve them when you're ready to show the
13:23
product resist the urge to take your
13:25
audience on a feature tour where you
13:28
walk from screen to screen showing them
13:30
everything your product can do instead
13:33
tell a story that shows exactly how your
13:35
main character solves her problem and
13:37
this is the point great demos actually
13:40
feel like good stories they have a flow
13:43
where each step leads to the next and
13:45
every feature you show has a clear
13:47
reason for being there they usually have
13:50
one or more magic moments where you
13:52
surprise your audience with how easy or
13:54
delightful something is and great demos
13:57
are also personalized for the audience
13:59
this is where you get to use all of the
14:01
information you collected during that
14:03
first call tailor the demo to their
14:06
company use their logo their website
14:09
their customers uh the names of the
14:11
people on their team the more you can do
14:13
to help them visualize exactly how your
14:15
product would work in their company the
14:17
better I'll give you an example from the
14:19
early days of optimizely when Dan and I
14:22
started building we booked demos with
14:24
all of our competitors and every single
14:27
one of them used a website to show what
14:30
it was like to use their products to run
14:33
AB tests and we thought this was really
14:35
lame so we spent weeks building a
14:37
feature that made it easy to demo our
14:39
product right on our customers websites
14:42
instead of a dummy website and I knew it
14:44
was worth it when I saw marketer eyes
14:46
light up when they watched us change
14:48
things on their landing page that would
14:50
have taken them months to do on their
14:51
own so if you do a good job your
14:54
prospects and their team will come out
14:56
of this meeting convinced that you can
14:58
solve their problem and if that's the
Pricing
15:00
case it's time to talk about pricing I
15:02
get a lot of questions from Founders
15:04
asking how to price their products and
15:06
the truth is there isn't a simple
15:08
formula for doing this so if there isn't
15:11
a formula how do you pick a number well
15:13
fortunately you can ask questions
15:15
earlier in the process that will make
15:17
your job easier here like how much is
15:19
this problem costing your company how
15:22
many people are responsible for
15:23
maintaining your in-house solution
15:25
what's your budget for solving this
15:27
problem how much are you spending on my
15:29
competitor and it's okay to wait to
15:32
share your pricing until you've had a
15:33
chance to ask these questions in fact if
15:36
your product requires lots of work or
15:39
customization to implement you probably
15:41
shouldn't quote a price until you
15:43
understand exactly what your customer
15:44
needs in any case even if you asked all
15:48
of these questions upfront the reality
15:50
is that pricing involves a lot of
15:51
guessing in the beginning and the advice
15:53
that I give to startups is to think of
15:55
each pricing conversation you have as an
15:58
opportunity to run an experiment in
16:00
which you test a price point and then
16:02
learn from your prospect's reaction to
16:04
it in the early days of optimizely we
16:06
had published self-serve pricing for
16:08
customers who just wanted to swipe a
16:10
credit card for a basic version of our
16:11
product and an Enterprise plan that
16:14
required you to go through sales we
16:16
didn't publish pricing for the
16:17
Enterprise plan which gave us the
16:19
flexibility to try a different price
16:21
each time the pricing mistake that
16:23
Founders make most often is charging too
16:26
little for their product or even making
16:28
it free in exchange for product feedback
16:30
Founders do this because they're worried
16:32
about charging too much they think
16:34
they're going to scare customers away
16:36
one of the most surprising things I
16:38
learned was that when a customer really
16:40
wants your product it's hard to scare
16:42
them away by quoting a price that's too
16:44
high for example I remember my
16:46
co-founder Dan coming out of a sales
16:48
call and telling me that he'd worked up
16:49
the nerve to quote the prospect $10,000
16:52
a month for our software and the
16:54
prospect ended up talking us down to
16:56
2,000 a month and then buying our
16:58
initial quote was 5x what they were
17:00
willing to pay and they still bought in
17:02
fact higher prices can help you figure
17:04
out whether customers actually need your
17:06
product the cison brothers famously
17:09
charged more for stripe in the beginning
17:11
than their competition did the fact that
17:13
they were able to sell their product
17:15
anyway was compelling evidence that they
17:17
were on to something and it helped them
17:19
focus on the customers who were most
17:21
desperate for a solution high prices
17:23
make customers more serious this brings
17:26
me to another important point about
17:27
pricing remember that the most important
17:30
conversations about pricing will happen
17:32
without you in the room your prospect
17:34
will need to convince others in the
17:36
organization that your product is worth
17:38
the price you're asking you can make
17:39
their job easier by giving them slides
17:42
or a PDF one pager that explains how
17:44
your pricing works it's usually a good
17:46
idea to include an overview of your
17:48
product and the benefits of using it in
17:50
case your prospect needs to talk to
17:52
people who aren't familiar with it in
17:54
any case don't spend too much time
17:56
thinking about pricing in the beginning
17:58
pick number ideally one that makes you a
18:00
little uncomfortable and pay attention
18:02
to how your prospect reacts it's okay to
18:05
let them negotiate you down remember in
18:08
your first few sales you're optimizing
18:10
for learning not unit economics now that
Closing
18:13
you've agreed on a price it's time to
18:15
close the deal closing is not a single
18:18
conversation it's a bunch of things that
18:20
need to happen from the moment your
18:22
customer decides they want your product
18:24
to the moment they actually buy it big
18:26
companies especially ones in highly
18:28
regulated Industries have formal
18:30
procurement processes that usually
18:32
include stuff like security and privacy
18:34
reviews legal reviews and signoff from
18:37
compliance teams it's less formal in
18:39
smaller companies but you should expect
18:41
at a minimum to go through a redlining
18:43
process with their legal team the
18:44
biggest mistake that I see Founders make
18:46
at this stage is getting surprised and
18:49
discovering that what they thought was a
18:50
done deal is in fact not done at all and
18:53
may take weeks or months of additional
18:55
back and forth or fall through
18:57
completely now the way to avoid getting
Avoid surprises in procurement process
18:59
surprised is once again to ask a lot of
19:02
questions asking your prospect upfront
19:05
how they buy software and who needs to
19:07
sign off will give you a clear picture
19:09
of the hurdles you're going to have to
19:11
overcome in order to get a signature you
19:13
should do everything you can at this
19:15
stage to move through the procurement
19:17
process quickly ask explicitly if there
19:21
are steps like filling out a security
19:22
questionnaire that you can get started
19:24
on early and execute in parallel and
19:26
keep your legal documents as simple as
19:28
possible I recommend starting with the
19:30
open- source templates published by YC
19:32
company common paper keep timelines and
19:34
scope of work out of the legal contract
19:36
if you can and put them in an order form
19:38
or a shared project tracking document
19:40
instead and most importantly remember
19:42
that your prospect who at this point has
19:44
become your Champion is your biggest
19:47
Ally you should be in constant
19:49
communication with them and when you
19:51
need help getting something unstuck you
19:53
should ask them first remember they
19:56
can't solve their problem until you get
19:58
through procurement so they're heavily
20:00
incentivized to help you make it happen
Implement
20:02
now that you have a signature
20:04
congratulations it's time for your
20:06
customer to actually start using your
20:08
product this is the implementation and
20:10
it's the last step we're going to talk
20:11
about today and I'm going to lead with
20:13
this the single biggest mistake that
20:16
Founders make is thinking that
20:18
implementation is the customer's job we
20:21
made this mistake more than once at
20:23
optimizely in fact we closed six figure
20:26
deals with customers that were excited
20:28
about our product and then we discovered
20:30
a year later when it was time for them
20:32
to renew that they hadn't run a single
20:34
AB test with optimizely and this was
20:36
confusing at first why would a customer
20:38
who is willing to pay so much for a
20:40
product fail to use it at all in this
20:43
case the approximate cause is that the
20:45
marketing team who bought our software
20:47
couldn't convince the software
20:48
engineering team to help them install it
20:50
on their website the real cause though
20:53
is we didn't do our jobs we thought our
20:55
customer was buying a product so we sold
20:57
them one and left the rest up to them in
21:00
reality our customers were buying a
21:03
solution to a problem and all of the
21:05
work required to get from product to
21:08
solution was our responsibility we
21:11
learned to start asking marketing
21:13
leaders about the work required to
21:15
implement optimizely very early in the
21:17
sales process we started building
21:20
detailed implementation plans with
21:22
marketing and Engineering leaders well
21:24
before a contract got signed and in fact
21:27
if we weren't able to do that we
21:29
wouldn't sign a contract at all and the
21:31
trick we learned was to treat the
21:33
customer implementation the same way
21:35
that we would a high priority project
21:37
inside of our own company by project
21:39
managing it so we put together a shared
21:41
road map we made sure that every task
21:44
headed owner we set up regular check-in
21:46
meetings to hold everyone on our side
21:48
and theirs accountable for getting it
21:50
done your sales funnel only really ends
21:53
when your customer is using your product
21:55
habitually and when you get to that
21:56
point congratulations hopefully you have
21:59
a customer for life all right we've
Outro
22:02
covered a lot today from prospecting to
22:05
doing your first call delivering a great
22:07
demo pricing closing and finally
22:10
managing the implementation of course
22:13
there's so much more to learn about
22:14
sales and the best Founders devour
22:17
everything they can on the topic if you
22:19
want to go deeper I recommend Peter
22:21
kazi's book founding sales it's a
22:24
fantastic resource and it's free online
22:27
but like most most of the hard things
22:29
about building a company the best way to
22:31
learn is by going out and doing the
22:32
thing so if you only remember one thing
22:34
it should be this just get started
22:37
you'll make mistakes but with enough
22:39
attempts you'll figure it out and
22:40
selling will start to feel natural
22:42
pretty soon you'll discover that you've
22:44
acquired a new superpower you'll find
22:46
it's useful not only in getting
22:48
customers and revenue but in fundraising
22:50
and hiring too and soon enough you'll be
22:53
the one giving advice like this to new
22:55
Founders thanks for watching
