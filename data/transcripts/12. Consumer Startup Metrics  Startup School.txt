welcome to metrics for Consumer startups
0:12
in our video on metrics for B2B startups
0:15
we talked about net dollar retention and
0:17
gross margin metrics that are most
0:19
important for B2B companies now we're
0:21
going to dig into metrics that are
0:22
particularly important for Consumer
0:24
companies I was previously the founder
0:26
of a consumer online bank called monzo
0:29
it's now up to about 8 million customers
0:31
in the UK and I also worked at grouper a
0:34
YC company that built a a group social
0:36
club and dating app so two consumer
0:39
companies I've also worked with dozens
0:41
of consumer companies here at YC for
0:43
Consumer companies growth headline user
0:46
growth is the most obvious metric that a
0:49
lot of people track the reason is often
0:52
monetization comes later um you might
0:55
have to build up some kind of network
0:57
effect or viral coefficient things will
0:59
go into later a good growth rate is 15%
Growth Rates
1:02
month over month at that rate you'll 5x
1:06
your user base every year 10% monthly
1:08
growth for Consumer company is okay it
1:10
means you'll approximately triple your
1:12
user base every year 5% a month or lower
1:15
is unlikely to reach breakout success
1:18
I'm afraid but growth is much more
1:20
complex than simply headline user
1:23
numbers we'll split first of all into
Organic vs. Paid Growth
1:25
organic versus paid growth so organic
1:27
growth is really anything you don't pay
1:29
for
1:30
and Founders running consumer companies
1:32
often neglect this we got to a million
1:35
customers at monzo before we spent any
1:38
money on Direct marketing or advertising
1:40
and really we did this in two ways
1:44
virality and network effect it's worth
1:47
pausing on these because they're so
1:48
important virality is the idea that one
1:52
user using your product introduces it to
1:55
other users somehow in the use of your
1:57
product whereas Network effect is the
2:00
idea that the product gets better uh
2:03
that more nodes in the network exist
2:04
I'll give you an example from Facebook's
2:06
early days so when you took a a picture
2:09
on Facebook and uploaded it you prompted
2:12
to tag your friends even if they weren't
2:14
already on Facebook and those friends
2:17
would get an email saying hey someone's
2:18
tagged a photo of you sign up to view
2:20
the photo that's a viral mechanic by
2:23
uploading the photo and tagging your
2:25
friends you spread it to New users
2:27
another example might be Wordle so when
2:29
people play Wordle they post their score
2:32
on social networks you see those little
2:34
green and and gray dots that's a signal
2:36
for everyone else there they're playing
2:38
uh this game and it attracts new people
2:40
into the game so that's virality a
2:44
network effect comes from meta's law the
2:46
value of the network is the square of
2:48
the nodes in a network and what that
2:49
basically means is the more people who
2:52
use this thing the more valuable it gets
2:54
and so WhatsApp is a great example of
2:56
this if you're the only one on WhatsApp
2:58
you know you can't message with anyone
3:00
it's pretty useless but the more people
3:03
you add to the product the more people
3:05
you invite the more useful it gets for
3:07
you you can message all these people
3:09
around the world for free and so the
3:11
best consumer companies incorporate both
3:14
virality and network effect which are
3:17
different concepts but very closely
3:18
related in order to grow their user base
3:21
organically so let's think about your
3:24
product How Could You incorporate both
3:27
of these things virality and netw effect
3:30
first of all for virality what are the
3:32
sharable moments what are the points at
3:34
which you you know you accomplished a
3:37
something new in the product you've you
3:39
know dualingo you've reached a new level
3:41
something you want to brag about or
3:42
Wordle you've completed it in two tries
3:44
or something uh what are those points in
3:47
the product uh where people naturally
3:50
are inclined to share it and then how
3:51
can you make it really easy with all of
3:53
those sharing prompts that um both IOS
3:55
and Android offer the second is Network
3:58
effect how could my product get better
4:02
than more people who join you have to
4:04
shift from thinking about your product
4:05
as a single player journey to a
4:07
multiplayer Journey so for something
4:08
like monzo which was a Neo Bank the
4:10
network effect with things like being
4:12
able to send and receive money really
4:14
quickly within the bank so we've built a
4:16
venmo style um money transmission within
4:19
the bank you could also open joint
4:21
accounts or have big pots for groups of
4:24
people who are going on a holiday and so
4:25
what we'd often see is a group of six or
4:28
seven people go on a holiday
4:30
the St only three people have monzo and
4:32
by the end of the holiday uh all of the
4:34
group have been bullied to to sign up to
4:36
monzo so they can jointly manage their
4:37
expenses that's a network effect working
4:40
on these Network effect and viral Loops
4:43
will pay back every day for the rest of
4:45
the life of the company where with ad
4:47
spend you spend the money one day
4:49
tomorrow it's gone you've got to keep
4:51
spending that money to keep acquiring
4:52
users viral loops and network effects
4:55
pay back forever so every one or 2%
4:58
extra you can op optimize in your viral
5:00
loops and your network effect will pay
5:02
back for the rest of the life of the
5:03
company paid referral schemes are a sort
5:06
of interesting blend it seems like
5:08
member get member where you know if you
5:10
refer a friend you get $5 and they get
5:12
$5 or maybe with Uber you get a free
5:13
ride they get a free ride I would treat
5:15
this as paid acquisition actually you're
5:17
spending money to acquire customers and
5:19
if you stop spending those customers
5:21
won't won't appear there are two things
5:23
to watch out for if you're doing this uh
5:25
these paid referral schemes first of all
Cannibalization
5:27
is cannibalization this is the idea that
5:30
people would have referred their friends
5:32
anyway and now by paying them you're
5:34
simply paying for users that would have
5:37
signed up for free so that's
5:39
cannibalization and you can test that by
5:41
only running your paid referral schemes
5:42
in certain parts of the country or
5:44
certain cities or turning it off for a
5:46
period of time and seeing what natural
5:48
organic rate of referral you get the
5:50
second thing you need to watch out for
5:52
is fraud honestly people somehow milking
5:55
your referral scheme so I had a friend
5:57
who in the early days of um of zip car
6:00
just set up a bunch of cheap Google ads
6:02
that bid on zip car and then would
6:04
redirect them straight to Zipcar and
6:05
milk the referral scheme and so he drove
6:07
free Zip Cars for a year and then got
6:09
banned for life from zip car so there
6:11
are always people doing this you've just
6:12
got to watch out for it it's just an
6:14
annoying cost okay so we talked about
6:17
organic growth and particularly Network
6:19
effect and and viral Loops now we're
Paid Growth
6:21
going to talk about paid growth so this
6:23
is the idea that you you know you you do
6:26
a pay-per-click campaign maybe you do
6:28
some TV advertising ing or advertising a
6:30
newspaper or whatever the first thing is
6:33
you have to have good tracking set up
6:35
you need to know where every user is
6:37
coming from did they come from your
6:39
Facebook ads or your Instagram ads or
6:41
that TV ad the simplest way for
6:42
pay-per-click ads is that UTM referr in
6:45
the URL if you can't get that or I know
6:47
recent changes to iOS has made it much
6:49
much harder to track you should just ask
6:51
your users when they signed up where
6:53
they heard about you you so you have to
6:55
measure this paid versus free and you've
6:56
got to know where they came from you can
6:59
get really convoluted with you know
7:01
first touch attribution last touch
7:03
multi-touch attribution
7:05
it's it's often way more hassle than
7:07
it's worth simply using those UTM
7:10
referrals or asking your customers where
7:11
they came where they heard about your
7:13
your business is probably the best way
7:15
for most of you so understanding where
7:17
each user came from and then how much
7:19
you spent on each Channel lets you
7:22
understand your customer acquisition
7:23
cost how much you spent for each channel
7:26
to acquire each User it's important that
7:29
you track this per Channel and then
7:32
crucially record that in your database
7:35
where each user came from record it
7:36
forever because you can then monitor the
7:39
performance of those customers over time
7:41
back at monzo we found a particular um
7:44
money-saving blog that was very very
7:46
cheap to get users from they sent us
7:48
hundreds and hundreds of users uh when
7:50
we were eventually paying for
7:51
advertising uh it seemed very very cheap
7:54
but the customers it turns out were
7:55
deeply unprofitable they would load
7:57
money onto their monzo card they'd go on
7:59
holiday
7:59
and then they instantly just go and take
8:01
,000 out from the ATM and just spend in
8:03
cash and we couldn't understand why this
8:05
was for a very very long time we
8:07
researched it but the the net result of
8:09
it was we shut down that advertising
8:11
Channel even though the cost of
8:13
acquisition looked really really good
8:14
for that channel the lifetime value of
8:17
those customers was negative the the
8:19
revenue and the profit they generated
8:20
was negative for the company because
8:22
they generated so much cost the second
8:24
thing for to watch out for for for CAC
8:26
for customer acquisition cost is you
8:29
have to measure it to an active
8:31
monetized retaining user whether
8:34
whatever that's defined as for your
8:35
business it might be a subscriber for
8:37
monzo it was a weekly active user you
8:39
have to measure it to get to a good user
8:41
not simply a sign up because you might
8:43
have 80 or 90% drop off rate in your
8:46
first week for example you've got to
8:48
track what does it cost us to generate a
8:51
user who sticks around for the longterm
8:53
who performs and retains like a like one
8:56
of our good users that's your customer
8:58
acquisition cost the best consumer
9:00
companies have a split of organic versus
9:04
paid growth of something like north of
9:07
80% organic to 20% paid even 100%
9:11
organic to 0% paid for some of the
9:13
absolute best consumer companies like
9:15
Facebook and and WhatsApp in the early
9:17
days a 50/50 split between paid and
9:19
organic is okay anything below 50/50 for
9:23
any period of time honestly is pretty
9:24
worrisome that's because if you're
9:26
relying too much on the big ad platforms
9:28
like Google and meta to increase your
9:32
growth you're basically just going to
9:33
have to pay them more money and as you
9:35
pay them more money to acquire more
9:36
users the cost to acquire each user goes
9:38
up and these ad platforms are really
9:40
well tuned to extracting the maximum
9:43
value from you and your competitors as
9:45
possible and so what happens is all
9:46
these competing companies bid and bid
9:48
and bid to get more and more and more
9:50
customers and see they're making less
9:52
and less profit on each customer because
9:54
they're requiring more and more to to
9:55
acquire them and at the end of the day
9:57
only Google and meta really win in that
10:00
battle You all take your margins to zero
10:04
and Google and meta end up making all
10:05
the money that's why it's so dangerous
10:08
to be so reliant on paid growth
10:10
similarly a big platform shift like the
10:12
changes to uh to the iOS platform to the
10:15
broke advertising tracking just wipes
10:17
out half of your business I've seen so
10:19
many companies overnight just die from
10:22
changes that made were made to the big
10:24
advertising platforms so please please
10:26
please focus on organic growth and
10:29
that's viral loops and network effect so
10:31
to finish up on paid growth I've not
10:34
seen any great consumer company get to
10:37
True scale where more than 50% of their
10:40
signups are coming from organic JS and
10:42
I'm sure someone out there will watch
10:44
this and find an example but
10:45
overwhelmingly the great consumer
10:47
companies that get to IPO scale to get
10:51
to really big scale um have optimized
10:54
their viral loops and their Network
10:55
effects to get the majority of their
10:57
growth from organic channs so now we're
Unit Economics
10:59
going to dive into unit economics this
11:01
is the idea that you can measure on a
11:03
per customer level how much revenue they
11:05
generate minus the variable or
11:08
incremental cost associated with serving
11:10
that warn customer so let's take monzo
11:12
an online bank when I was there just a
11:14
few years ago these numbers aren't
11:16
current each customer generated about
11:18
$50 in Revenue but we had a lot of costs
11:21
to serve each customer so for example
11:24
sending out a new plastic card and a
11:26
replacement plastic card whenever they
11:28
were lost was a variable cost the cost
11:30
of customer service so the more each
11:33
customer contacted customer service the
11:35
more cost that would generate any fraud
11:37
on the account or any transaction fees
11:40
to to make a bank payment or wire fees
11:42
all of those were cost that monzo would
11:45
bear and then we track those on a per
11:47
customer basis this is very very
11:50
important because you can then
11:52
understand not just how profitable or
11:55
unprofitable the entire customer base is
11:57
but for each sing single customer and
11:59
each cohort of customer how they
12:02
performed so for example we discovered
12:05
that customers at monzo who traveled
12:07
abroad very often would earn a lot more
12:09
revenue or customers who came in Via a
12:12
certain advertising Channel I mentioned
12:14
earlier might take money out of ATMs and
12:17
incur massive costs there or certain
12:18
kind of customers might contact customer
12:21
service very very regularly and incur a
12:23
lot of cost there and so this really
12:26
matters in an operationally complex
12:28
business where you've got thin margins
12:30
it's really important that you
12:31
understand on a per customer basis how
12:33
much revenue each customer generates and
12:35
then how much variable cost each
12:37
customer generates and you can optimize
12:40
it so you can start reducing the cost or
12:42
you can start investing in the
12:44
advertising channels that bring the
12:46
kinds of customers who tend to generate
12:49
higher revenue and lower cost so rather
12:51
than tracking these on a a really broad
12:54
basis the more granular you can get on
12:56
these costs the better so quick note
12:58
things that aren't included in variable
13:00
costs are those fixed costs the things
13:02
that if you doubled or tripled your
13:03
customer base really those costs
13:05
wouldn't change at all so those might be
13:07
engineering salaries or the rent on your
13:09
head office those are the things that
13:11
you deduct afterwards to get to your
13:14
total profit line at the bottom so for
13:16
uni economics you really want to take
13:17
your Revenue minus your variable costs
13:20
those are costs that vary as you
13:23
increase the number of customers and as
13:25
we talked about in the video on Gross
13:27
margins scaling negative unit economics
13:30
is very very dangerous in the early days
13:32
of monzo we were AT3 or4 per customer
13:37
per year and we scale to half a million
13:39
customers before we fix them earn a lot
13:41
of capital so beware pay attention to un
13:44
economics and try to get them positive
13:46
before you scale up your user base okay
13:48
next retention we talked about retention
13:51
in our B2B video and particularly net
13:53
dollar retention it's pretty easy in uh
13:56
B2B SAS companies when you have a
13:58
recurring contract with a paying
14:00
customer to know whether they've churned
14:01
or not with consumer it's often a little
14:04
harder especially when they're not a
14:05
subscriber but they just periodically
14:07
use your product like Airbnb and the
14:09
complicated question is what is the
14:12
right period to measure to tell if
14:14
there's still an active customer or not
14:16
should they be using a product every day
14:18
or every week or month or even year so
14:20
for Facebook an active user might be
14:22
checking Facebook once or multiple times
14:24
a day but with Airbnb you might only
14:27
book a vacation home every six months
14:30
and so for your business it's really
14:33
important to think for a successful
14:35
customer so want someone who really
14:36
likes the product how often would they
14:39
typically be using this service so for
14:42
monzo we chose one transaction at least
14:44
one financial transaction every week it
14:46
can be hard to measure retention in
14:48
consumer startups especially when you've
14:50
decided that the relevant usage period
14:53
might be months or even years bit like
14:55
Airbnb or an airline booking so what
14:58
some companies figured out is you can
15:00
look for what's called a magic moment
15:04
this user Behavior or activity that is
15:07
correlated with or predicts long-term
15:09
retention so the way you go about that
15:11
is you analyze a group of your best
15:13
users and compare their behavior how
15:16
they use the product to the rest of your
15:18
customer base so a famous example was
15:20
Facebook they figured out that if you
15:23
added seven friends in your first 10
15:26
days of usage you'd overwhelmingly go on
15:28
to become long-term happy users of
15:31
Facebook whereas if you didn't add
15:33
friends in your first 10 days it's much
15:35
more likely you churn off for monzo we
15:37
had something similar because we had a
15:39
bank account but also this venmo like
15:41
functionality built into the product
15:42
where you could send and receive money
15:44
customers who added three friends from
15:47
their phone book to their monzo account
15:48
so they could send and receive money as
15:50
they signed up retain something like 20
15:52
percentage points better than users who
15:55
didn't have any friends in their first
15:57
few days so once you figured out what
15:59
your magic moment is might be adding
16:01
friends like Facebook or monzo or it
16:04
might be booking a stay and having a
16:05
fstar experience as with Airbnb you can
16:08
try to re-engineer your product
16:10
unboarding to make sure that as many
16:13
users as possible Hit This Magic Moment
16:16
as soon as possible so for Facebook it
16:18
was getting that ad friend uh popup
16:21
inside the signup flow making sure that
16:23
everyone who joined Facebook was
16:26
prompted to add friends and so for your
16:28
product think about what that magic
16:29
moment could be and how you can
16:31
re-engineer the signup flow to get as
16:34
many users as possible hitting that
16:36
point there is a mistake here and then I
16:38
definitely uh fell victim to this it's
16:41
getting too fixated on that precise
16:44
definition of that magic moment for
16:45
Facebook it probably didn't matter that
16:47
much whether it was seven friends or
16:49
eight friends or six friends simply
16:51
finding that kind of Tipping Point that
16:53
looks about right from your metrics and
16:56
then agreeing with everyone that that's
16:57
what you're going to optimize for rather
16:59
than being really pedantic about the
17:01
exact definition it's probably the best
17:03
way to go the next thing we're going to
Net Promoter Score (NPS)
17:04
talk about for Consumer startup metrics
17:06
is the net promoter score again this is
17:09
a three-letter acronym NPS that sounds
17:11
pretty complicated but it's pretty much
17:13
a measure of How likely you are to
17:16
recommend this product to a friend you
17:18
ask it to your customers and it's a
17:19
scale of 0 to 10 and you basically take
17:24
all the people who are promoters and
17:26
that's a n or 10 and then you net off
17:29
hence the net the detractors that's
17:32
people who rate you 0 to six and that'll
17:35
give you a score so if everyone is a
17:38
detractor all people who vote voted at
17:40
zero you'd have a negative 100 100% of
17:43
people were detractors if 100% of people
17:46
were promoters you had zero detractors
17:48
100 minus zero you have a plus 100 net
17:51
promoter score another example say you
17:53
have 50 promoters 50 scoring 9 or 10 25
17:57
in the middle 25 neutral you don't do
17:59
anything with those you just ignore them
18:00
and then minus 25 detractors those who
18:03
people who are scoring at 0 to six 50us
18:06
25 your MPS is positive 25 if your net
18:11
promoter score your MPS is not extremely
18:13
high as a new consumer company your
18:15
toast you pretty much have to
18:17
re-engineer the product to make it
18:20
something that people love the reason is
18:23
it correlates extremely well with Word
18:25
of Mouth referral so I would argue
18:28
positive 50 is pretty much a minimum
18:30
Baseline for any new consumer company
18:33
you have to be in order of magnitude
18:34
better than your competitors mono for
18:36
example hovered somewhere between
18:38
positive 75 and positive 80 while I was
18:41
there I looked up Tesla it's currently
18:43
at positive 96 so the best consumer
18:47
companies always always have a Sky High
18:50
net promoter score and you if you look
18:52
at old incumbents people like cell phone
18:54
companies or really old Banks their net
18:57
promoter scores are often
18:58
zero or even negative that's a really
19:01
good sign that you could disrupt those
19:03
Industries with great customer service
19:05
and a great mobile proposition how you
19:08
gather this score is extremely important
19:11
so you ask this question to your
19:13
customers it might be every month or so
19:15
with a random sample or at a certain
19:16
point in the product but the crucial
19:18
thing is that you keep it consistent if
19:21
you change the point in the app or the
19:24
the point in the customer's lifetime
19:26
when you ask this question you're going
19:28
to change the values you get you're
19:30
going to change the responses and your
19:32
net promoter score will jump around
19:34
wildly and you won't know whether it's
19:37
something you've changed or simply an
19:39
artifact of you having changed the
19:40
collection method we fell into this trap
19:42
at grouper dating website I worked at we
19:45
changed the collection method and the
19:47
net promoter score decreased by 20
19:49
percentage points overnight we couldn't
19:50
figure it out so it's crucial you ask
19:53
this in the same way of all of customers
19:57
at various points in time that you don't
19:59
change this and finally on NPS you can
20:01
influence this this figure in particular
20:03
as a next question after people have
20:05
answered whether they recommend this to
20:07
a friend you should ask a qualitative
20:10
question why why do you like the product
20:13
or what's wrong with it and then in
20:15
particular you can go and look at all of
20:17
the detractors and you can fix all of
20:19
the things they don't like and that's a
20:20
sure fire way to increase your net
20:22
promoter score okay we've covered a lot
Recap
20:24
of stuff in consumer metrics today let's
20:27
quickly recap first of all is your
20:29
growth rate at least 15% month-on-month
20:32
growth in active users is the target 10%
20:36
is okay 5% is probably not going to cut
20:38
it for Consumer startup we talked about
20:40
organic versus paid growth you really
20:43
need at least 50% organic to get to any
20:45
kind of scale if you've got more than
20:47
50% of your growth coming from Paid
20:49
channels I'd suggest in the long term
20:52
you have a problem that you need to fix
20:54
so focus on virality and network effect
20:57
to get the those organic signups humming
21:00
if you're not already start tracking
21:02
unit economics this is the amount of
21:04
Revenue each customer generates minus
21:07
the variable cost that each customer
21:09
creates if your unit economics are
21:11
negative you must fix them before you
21:13
scale then we talked about retention
21:16
retention needs to flatten off somewhere
21:18
if your retention periods are really
21:20
long if people only come back every 6
21:21
months or year look for a magic moment
21:24
in your product that moment where users
21:26
finally discover the aha moment and are
21:28
more likely to convert to long-term
21:30
happy users and the net promoter score
21:33
plus 50 as a minimum for great consumer
21:36
startups and don't mess around with how
21:38
you're measuring net promoter score
21:40
you're likely to throw off your metrics
21:41
and confuse yourself a final warning
21:44
these are all benchmarks your company
21:47
and your industry May well be different
21:50
you may have off the charts organic
21:52
growth and very poor unit economics like
21:55
early monzo or you might have really
21:57
really good economics and pretty slow
22:00
growth that rely on paid ads every
22:03
business is different and it's hard to
22:05
give cookie cutter benchmarks for
22:06
everything so just think about these
22:08
metrics and how they might be different
22:10
for your business I hope these are
22:11
useful in running your company thanks
