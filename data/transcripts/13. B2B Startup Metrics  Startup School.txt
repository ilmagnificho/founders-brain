0:09
hi there my name is Tom blumfield I'm a
0:12
group partner at Y combinator and today
0:14
we're going to be talking about one of
0:15
my favorite topics metrics and why
0:18
they're so useful for startups so why
Importance of Metrics
0:21
are metrics important first of all it's
0:23
pretty obvious that with better metrics
0:25
you'll make better decisions it's like
0:28
flying an airplane with no instrument
0:30
you're Flying Blind you don't know
0:32
what's happening to the aircraft and
0:33
you're not in control having great
0:35
metrics is like having great instruments
0:37
in an aircraft it lets you tweak and
0:38
iterate and make sure you're really in
0:40
control of your startup we often see and
0:43
I've seen in even in the last two or
0:45
three weeks Founders who've had these
0:47
great launches they've launched on
0:49
Hacker News on product hunt and they've
0:52
had hundreds of people come and use
0:54
their service day after day but they
0:56
have no idea how many of those news
0:58
users are new users or returning users
1:00
they don't know if they're daily active
1:01
or weekly active they could be churning
1:03
off all of their users instantly and
1:05
they don't know at all so the first
1:07
thing they do after launching blind is
1:10
to go back and build metrics in we would
1:13
advise you don't do that you should
1:14
build basic metrics into a product
Pre-launch Metrics
1:16
before you launch and as an investor
1:19
it's really easy to tell Founders who
1:22
are in command of their metrics versus
1:24
Founders who aren't and it's really
1:26
impressive when founders can talk about
1:29
what percentage best signups are da or W
1:32
or what the annual revenue per user is
1:35
and we'll go into some of these in
1:37
detail but it's a big differentiator
1:39
when a Founder can talk so fluently
1:40
about these metrics before we dive in I
1:43
want to give a couple of warnings The
1:46
Other Extreme is also bad so it's a
1:49
Founder who even before they launched
1:51
has a dashboard with perhaps 500 metrics
1:54
maybe they've been a product manager at
1:56
a big tech company or they've just
1:57
watched too many YouTube videos but they
1:59
want to make every decision in their
2:01
startup with metrics and when you have
2:03
only have a few hundred or a few
2:05
thousand users that's basically
2:07
impossible you know they want to split
2:08
test everything should this button be
2:10
blue or green and frankly it doesn't
2:13
matter and you don't have the volume of
2:15
users or data to make those kind of
2:17
split tests sensibly so what you should
2:20
do is certainly split test the really
2:22
important decisions you know should the
Metric Overload Caution
2:23
cost per user be $80 per year or $200
2:27
per year that's a really good experiment
2:29
to split test but you know making
2:31
buttons red or green that's not really
2:33
something you have the scale to split
2:34
test until you're really at the the size
2:36
of Google or Facebook a final warning
2:39
don't hide behind your metrics you've
2:41
still got to get out of the building and
2:43
talk to customers Brian from Airbnb
2:46
still hosts Airbnb users in his home
2:49
it's an obsession with staying close to
2:51
customers so you can't let metrics get
2:53
in the way of that so let's get started
2:56
you're planning a product launch in
2:58
perhaps a week or two and maybe maybe
2:59
you've not got any metrics in place yet
3:01
what do you do the first thing is to
3:03
pick four or five key metrics to track
3:06
accurately not 30 or 50 four or five is
3:10
fine this number will grow over time
3:12
we'll talk about what those key metrics
3:13
should be in eight a little bit you
3:15
should pick the most straightforward
Key Metrics Selection
3:17
analytics solution you can operate it
3:19
might just be uh your SQL database
3:21
making simple SQL queries to count to
3:23
the number of signups post hog from
3:26
Winter 2020 has a great SQL Analytics
3:29
tool you can use on top of pretty much
3:31
any SQL database so you should check
3:33
that out you should also agree the
3:34
definitions of these four or five key
3:36
metrics and stick with them so it might
3:39
not be the absolute perfect definition
3:41
of an active user but constant arguments
3:44
about what your key metrics are are even
3:46
worse than having no metrics at all so
3:48
your whole team has to come together and
3:50
agree that an active user is someone who
3:53
uses the product every day or at least
3:55
once a week or at least five times a
3:57
week it honestly matters matters less
4:00
the precise definition than you actually
4:02
all agree with it I've remember so many
4:06
disagreements where the marketing team
4:08
said you know we've sent you 2,500 New
4:11
Leads this month and the sales team says
4:13
no no no they weren't qualified leads
4:15
they don't meet our definitions and this
4:16
disagreement internally just destroys
4:19
the productivity of meetings where
4:21
metrics are involved so you really have
4:22
to have centralized definitions of
4:24
metrics that are written down and
4:26
everyone agrees on so say you launched
4:28
and perhaps the metrics aren't quite
4:30
what you hoped the weekly active users
4:32
aren't quite as high as you you
4:34
originally wanted in that situation
4:35
Founders are often tempted to pick a
4:38
different metric or change the
4:40
definition of those metrics so instead
4:41
of a weekly active let's go for a
4:42
monthly active the number looks a bit
4:44
better honestly you're only fooling
4:45
yourself in this situation it's really
4:48
really important that you keep the
4:50
definition of your metric consistent
4:51
over time to see if you're improving or
Consistency in Metrics
4:54
not that's why it's so hard to compare
4:56
metrics between different companies
4:59
definition just vary so a weekly active
5:01
user at my company monzo was someone who
5:05
transacted who made a financial
5:06
transaction at least once a week an
5:09
active user at some of our competitors
5:11
used different definitions maybe it was
5:12
every two weeks or eight weeks and so
5:14
this active us account between companies
5:16
just became totally meaningless just
5:18
important that you keep it internally
5:20
consistent so you're keeping a good
5:21
track of it so now let's talk about what
5:24
those key metrics are those four or five
5:27
you should really start tracking from
5:29
early on it will vary from every company
5:31
back in the early days of the internet
5:33
companies like to use metrics like page
5:35
views or unique visitors or something
5:38
like that because they're really really
5:39
big numbers and startup Founders love to
5:41
report really big numbers you've
5:43
probably heard the term vanity metrics
5:46
these are numbers that seem really
5:47
really big and perhaps they keep
5:48
increasing they're not actually tied to
5:51
the success of your company more
5:52
recently common vanity metrics are
5:54
things like gmv or gross merchandise
5:57
value that's the total dollar value of
6:00
goods that are sold on eBay rather than
6:02
eBay's Revenue itself or gross
6:03
transaction value for a fintech like
6:05
monzo you could report we're transacting
6:07
$50 billion do a year it sounds like a
6:09
really really big number but the revenue
6:12
that the company makes can be very very
6:13
different and so almost always
6:16
especially for B2B companies your key
6:18
metric should be Revenue if you pick
6:22
another number take gross transaction
6:24
value you'll find that your employees
6:28
and eventually you might might start
6:29
optimizing for that number I worked with
6:31
a Neo Bank a couple of batches ago in
6:33
the Middle East and they were reporting
6:35
gross transaction value and they're very
6:36
very happy they came to every group
6:38
office hours and their gross transaction
6:39
value was growing 50% every two weeks it
6:43
looked really great and we scratched
6:44
beneath the surface a little bit and it
6:46
turned out that they were signing up
6:48
much much bigger customers who had
6:50
higher transaction value but giving them
6:52
massive cash back massive rebates to
6:54
transact on the platform so whilst gross
6:57
transaction value was Rising every two
6:59
week weeks Revenue actually was pretty
7:01
flat for about the last two months the
7:04
founders were tricking themselves they
7:05
were fooling themselves into thinking
7:07
their company was succeeding when in
7:09
fact it was pretty flat in Revenue terms
7:11
so revenue is the key metric I would
Investor Update Metrics
7:13
suggest for most B2B companies and don't
7:16
hide if your Revenue isn't good one of
7:18
the most impressive Founders I've ever
7:20
worked with sent 10 successive monthly
7:23
investor update emails with zero with a
7:26
big zero as the main metric at the top
7:29
of the emailed she kept herself honest
7:31
she was honest with investors and it
7:33
became clear what they needed to focus
7:35
on to fix the company so if you ashamed
7:37
of this number you hide it away it's
7:39
easy to kid yourself but I think if you
7:41
put it up front and Central and pay
7:43
attention to it it's the right thing to
7:45
focus on so two other key metrics
7:47
especially for investor updates
7:48
alongside your Revenue please include
7:51
burn rate that should be net what that
7:54
means is monthly costs minus your
7:57
revenues if you're loss making which
7:59
most early startups are it's the amount
8:01
by which your bank balance decreases
8:04
every month that is your burn rate and
8:06
your Runway is a function of that so say
8:08
you have a million dollar in the bank
8:10
and your burn rate is $100,000 a month
8:13
that means you have 10 months Runway
8:15
that means in 10 months you're going to
8:17
run out of money and the the startup
8:18
will be bankrupt those three numbers
8:21
Revenue burn rate and Runway are
8:23
absolutely crucial to include and if
8:26
they're not at the top of your investor
8:27
updates honestly I always uh assume this
8:30
founder has something to hide for
8:32
Consumer companies we have a separate
8:34
video diving deep into the metrics that
8:37
are important for those kind of startups
8:39
and often revenue is very important but
8:41
for the earliest days of consumer
8:43
companies often you're trying to get
8:45
some kind of critical mass or network
8:46
effect and so growing the active user
8:49
base in the early days for a consumer
8:51
company might in some cases be more
8:54
important than Revenue so we've talked
8:55
about the main three metrics that should
8:58
be at the top of every investor update
9:00
that's Revenue burn rate and Runway now
9:02
we're going to dive a little bit deeper
9:04
one of the most important metrics for
9:06
all startups really is retention this is
9:09
the idea that if you sign up a 100
9:12
paying customers say you sign them up in
9:14
January how many are still paying you in
Retention's Significance
9:17
February March and April two months 3
9:19
months four months later that's your
9:21
retention rate so it might be 80% or 70%
9:26
it's a sign that people love your
9:27
product they keep coming back and they
9:29
keep paying for it so you can measure it
9:31
for all customers who signed up in
9:33
January and the subsequent months and
9:34
that's your January cohort and then you
9:37
measure the same for all of the
9:38
customers who signed up in February
9:40
that's your February cohort and you can
9:41
stack these cohorts on top of each other
9:44
and there are a number of different ways
9:45
of graphing this you might have a heat
9:47
map and some analytics tools do this
9:49
really nicely you might have a curve
9:51
that sort of decays over time those are
9:53
two pretty common ways of graphing it
9:55
and we'll show some examples but I'd
9:57
like to suggest a third way this is is
9:59
when it really clicked for me I'd heard
10:01
everyone tell me that Revenue was really
10:03
really important but it only really
10:05
clicked for me after I worked at a
10:08
dating startup that actually had very
10:09
bad retention and ultimately failed
10:11
sadly but it clicked when I stacked
10:13
these cohorts on top of each other so
10:15
you see the January cohort at the bottom
10:17
and then the February cohort and then
10:18
the March cohort and the April cohort
10:20
and what happens if you have sticky
10:23
cohorts if your retention is really high
10:24
you know 80 90 100% is you cohorts stay
10:28
really fat over time and you build up
10:30
this layer cake so you can imagine what
10:32
happens two or three years later if you
10:35
have dozens of these monthly cohorts
10:37
stacked on top of each other they're all
10:40
paying you money they're all
10:41
contributing to your Revenue every
10:42
single month even three years later and
10:44
if you're in a low churn business it
10:46
adds up to a layer cake that looks
10:48
something like this so this is an
10:50
18month graph of monthly cohorts each
10:53
month you're adding a new layer on and
10:55
after 18 months you've got 18 cohorts
10:58
still paying you this was like my first
11:00
company go cardless it was a a recurring
11:03
payments company very similar to stripe
11:05
and with those kind of companies people
11:07
Implement a payment solution once they
11:09
don't really like to change it every
11:10
month there's a lot of effort so the
11:12
customers are very very sticky and you
11:14
can imagine the team at go cardless goes
11:17
on holiday you know for a month after 18
11:19
months and the revenue stays pretty
11:22
consistent the beauty is actually
11:24
expanding Revenue so if those customers
11:27
you signed up in January launch grow
11:30
with the company they're using goard or
11:32
stripe as a payment processor they're
11:34
transacting more volume in year two and
11:37
year three they're growing their
11:38
business the revenue for for strip or go
11:41
carders actually increases as well so
11:43
the team perhaps goes on holiday or
11:45
signs up no new customers the business
11:47
still grows Revenue that's the beauty of
11:50
this this High retention business it's
11:52
sort of growing constantly underneath
11:54
you you're adding these layers and
11:56
layers and layers of Revenue and
11:57
eventually become Unstoppable but that
11:59
only happens if your retention flattens
12:01
out at some point if these Decay curves
12:04
flatten at some point and it almost
12:06
matters that they flatten out at any
12:07
point as opposed to a high point you
12:09
know I I take a 20% retention that
12:11
flattens out over a higher retention
12:14
initially that goes to zero because if
12:15
you sign up 100 people in January and by
12:17
month three or month six they've all
12:19
churn off they've all stopped paying you
12:22
get a very different layer cake that
12:24
lovely flat layer cake that builds up
12:26
and up over time if your customers all
12:28
churn out looks like this so you can see
12:30
customers you sign up in month one by
12:32
month three have more or less gone and
12:33
let's fast forward to month six they've
12:36
all gone by month 9 or month 10 and so
12:39
rather than building up secure and
12:41
steadfast layers month after month
12:43
you're actually scrambling to fill up a
12:45
leaky bucket you're pouring water into
12:48
the top of the bucket and it's leaking
12:50
out of the bucket just as fast as you
12:52
can fill it up you can imagine this is
12:53
an impossible task and so if your
12:56
business has customers that that don't
12:58
retain where retention goes to zero
13:00
you'll reach some natural Plateau where
13:03
you're working as hard as you can to
13:05
fill up the customers who simply churned
13:07
out last month and it's very very hard
13:09
to build a big business like that it's a
13:11
futile Endeavor so we talked about
B2B SaaS: Net Dollar Retention
13:13
overall retention number of customers
13:16
for B2B startups people often talk about
13:19
net dollar retention this is just a
13:21
fancy way of calculating retention
13:23
mostly used in B2B SAS companies so
13:25
let's take an example we've started an
13:27
AI customer service chatbot very uh
13:30
invogue at the moment and say we we sign
13:32
up 10 paying customers in January in the
13:35
first month and they're each paying
13:38
$10,000 a month so 10K Mr each you're at
13:42
100K of monthly recurring Revenue feels
13:45
pretty good right let's fast forward a
13:47
year and in each of those subsequent
13:48
months you'll have signed up more
13:49
customers let's let's ignore them for
13:51
now focus on those 10 initial customers
13:53
you signed up in January but fast
13:55
forward 12 months perhaps two of those
13:57
customers have canceled their contracts
13:59
at some point in the year so we're down
14:00
to
14:02
$80,000 of monthly revenue from that
14:04
cohort but you've also upsold three
14:07
customers perhaps you've introduced some
14:08
new functionality or they've they're
14:10
using it more and instead of paying
14:12
10,000 they're each paying 20,000
14:15
perhaps you do phone chat as well as
14:17
text chat so that's $30,000 of
14:20
additional Revenue so we've lost 20 but
14:22
gained 30 so that's net 10K plus so
14:27
$110,000 of monthly revenue from that
14:29
January cohort that's why it's called
14:30
net dollar retention it's the amount
14:32
you've gained that's netted off against
14:34
the amount you've lost so that cohort
14:36
that was making $100,000 at the start in
14:39
January of year one a year later January
14:42
of year two is making a
14:44
$110,000 that's equivalent to 110% net
14:48
dollar retention so a net dollar
14:50
retention above 100% means your cohorts
14:53
are growing over time if your net dollar
14:55
attention is below 100% they're
14:57
shrinking over time youve got to pour
14:59
more water into the funnel to fill up
15:00
the the Leaky buckets we talked about
15:02
and that's what gives very sticky
15:04
businesses like stripe like go carders
15:06
like PayPal this exponential growth it's
15:10
adding new customers every month but
15:11
having existing customers grow
15:13
underneath them as well and that gives
15:15
you this exponential growth curve that's
15:17
very very impressive the final thing as
15:19
a benchmark any early stage B2B SAS
15:23
company should be looking at net dollar
15:25
retention well above 100% this is for
15:28
several reasons first of all you've
15:30
probably underpriced your product with
15:32
your first launch so you might charge
15:35
$10,000 a month for your initial
15:37
customers you realize pretty quickly uh
15:39
that the product could be sold for 20 or
15:41
$30,000 secondly you're adding features
15:44
the whole time presumably you're
15:45
improving your product and so that makes
15:47
it more appealing and customers are
15:49
willing to pay more money thirdly you
15:52
should be getting it better at sales and
15:53
upselling over time as well it' be weird
15:56
if you weren't getting better at that
15:57
and so those three reasons net dollar
16:00
retention for early stage B2B startup
16:02
should be 125% 150% would be great even
16:06
higher than that for mature companies uh
16:09
in the same range 110% 120% is pretty
16:11
good net dollar attention if your net
16:14
dollar attention is below 100%
16:17
especially for Enterprise B2B SAS
16:19
something is wrong you are churning off
16:21
customers they don't love the product
16:23
and I would invest in fixing that
16:25
talking to customers and figuring out
16:27
why they're turning off rather than
16:29
trying to to shove more customers in the
16:31
top of the funnel by investing in sales
16:33
and marketing for example net dollar
16:35
retention is absolutely crucial for B2B
16:37
SAS companies okay the second Deep dive
16:40
we're going to do on B2B metrics and
16:42
this is applicable to Consumer companies
16:44
as well is gross margin gross margin is
16:48
your Revenue the money you get from
Cruciality of Gross Margin
16:50
customers minus the cost of goods sold
16:53
so you can imagine that if you're a
16:55
grocery store that's most obvious you're
16:56
selling you're selling sandwiches for
16:58
example the cost of good sold is the
17:00
cost of the bread and the cost of the
17:01
butter and the the filling that goes in
17:03
the sandwich that's cost of good sold
17:05
for a software company it's any cost
17:09
that varies per customer or for each
17:12
incremental customer you incur more cost
17:15
so let's go back to example we had
17:16
earlier we were running a an AI customer
17:19
service bot and you're probably using
17:21
something like open AI or anthropic to
17:23
power the core model behind that and so
17:26
the cost the credits that you pay to
17:28
open AI or anthropic or someone else is
17:31
your cost of goods sold we didn't used
17:33
to talk about this very much for B2B SAS
17:34
companies because the cost of goods was
17:36
very very minimal for Pure software it
17:38
might have been your AWS bill or your
17:40
bandwidth bill or something like that
17:41
it's minimal and so pure B2B SAS
17:44
companies in the past might have had
17:45
gross margins of 95% you know you sell
17:48
$100 worth of software and it's only $5
17:51
of cost and so people just assume it's
17:53
very very high margin but these days as
17:56
software sort of taking over more and
17:58
more Industries gross margin has become
18:01
more and more important so for AI
18:02
companies today the gross margin the
18:04
amount they pay to open AI or anthropic
18:07
or others for the foundation model is a
18:09
really important cost and by the way
18:11
just because you're getting free credits
18:13
doesn't mean that that's a cost that
18:15
doesn't exist it just means you're
18:16
hiding it for the moment so companies
18:18
that hide behind open AI credits and
18:19
claim that they've got these huge huge
18:21
gross margins have a nasty shock coming
18:24
when those credits run out it's also why
18:27
heavily operational businesses are so
18:30
tricky and when a company joins YC with
18:33
a with something like a grocery delivery
18:35
business or really any kind of business
18:38
where a lot of humans involved a lot of
18:39
operational processes going along you
18:41
maybe you paint houses or install heat
18:44
pumps or something you have to pay a lot
18:45
more attention to the gross margin
18:47
because it's very rare that it's as high
18:48
as 95% you might be down at 5 10 15%
18:52
gross margins which means you have to do
18:54
a lot more work you have to get a lot
18:56
more customers a lot more Revenue to
18:58
generate the same gross margin and that
19:00
gross margin is the thing that can then
19:02
pay your head office rent your
19:04
engineering salaries all of those
19:06
remaining costs that don't vary per
19:08
customer but still have to be deducted
19:10
before you get to profitability and so
19:12
for operationally intensive businesses
19:14
we often try to work with Founders to
19:16
see if there's a software only version
19:19
of their business that they can run at a
19:21
much higher margin so for example
19:23
instead of running a delivery company
19:26
where you have Vans and bikes and
19:28
and delivery people instead can you take
19:31
the software that powers all of that and
19:34
sell it to other delivery companies
19:36
you're going to have a probably a much
19:38
easier life certainly you're going to
19:39
have much higher gross margins if you do
19:41
that so in the zero interest rate
19:44
environment sort of 2010 to 2021 period
19:50
companies were scaling negative margin
19:53
businesses because Capital was so cheap
19:56
famously Uber did this they used capital
19:58
as a weapon so they took these
20:00
businesses that were initially negative
20:02
gross margin that means they're
20:04
effectively selling $10 worth of service
20:06
but only charging $9 so losing money on
20:09
every single order but trying to get to
20:11
a sort of a network effect or a Tipping
20:13
Point um for Uber famously it was a
20:16
certain number of drivers certain
20:17
density of drivers and riders in a
20:19
certain city that gets the flywheel
20:21
going but when they launched in a new
20:22
city they didn't have that density and
20:24
so they had to subsidize drivers and
20:26
subsidize Riders which made it a
20:28
negative gross margin business and so
20:30
they raised enormous amounts of capital
20:32
to expand across the globe before
20:34
competitors could catch up but burnt
20:36
tens of billions of dollars of invested
20:38
money in doing so and that Blitz scaling
20:41
approach that that scaling of negative
20:43
margin got popular with Founders and so
20:46
we saw it in ride sharing then we saw it
20:48
in 10-minute grocery delivery we saw it
20:50
with electric scooters and honestly
20:52
there's like a a whole Wasteland of
20:55
startups that tried to do that and then
20:58
realize they couldn't continue to raise
21:00
money as investors just didn't want to
21:01
keep subsidizing these businesses and
21:04
certainly now with much higher interest
21:06
rates Capital has become much more
21:08
expensive investors are really really
Challenges of Negative Margin Scaling
21:10
loed to invest in negative margin
21:13
businesses and it's much much harder to
21:15
scale those those negative margins we
21:17
did this at monzo so monzo was an online
21:20
bank in the UK and for our first half
21:22
million customers or so we were losing
21:24
money on every customer 30 or 40 per
21:27
customer customer we scale to more than
21:29
half a million of those customers it
21:31
costs a lot but we had a plan to turn it
21:33
around so we brought technology in house
21:36
we didn't rely so much on external
21:38
vendors we introduced charges for
21:40
certain things we introduced new
21:42
products that customers were happy to
21:43
pay for and over time we flipped those
21:46
negative unit economics so rather than
21:48
losing 30 or 40 pounds per customer we
21:51
ended up when I was there making 30 or
21:53
40 pound per customer and now three or
21:55
four years later monzo is profitable so
21:57
if if you start with negative unit
21:59
economics you really really have to have
22:02
a plan to fix them and I would really
22:04
advise you don't scale your customer
22:06
base you don't try and grow as quickly
22:08
as possible whilst you have negative
22:10
unit economics you fix them first and
22:13
then you scale pH we covered a lot of
22:16
stuff today so as a recap we talked
Metrics Recap
22:19
about revenue and why it's the best core
22:22
metric for most B2B companies then we
22:25
talked about retention and it's fancy
22:27
cousin net dollar retention and why
22:29
having a net dollar retention above 100%
22:32
is so important for B2B startups and we
22:35
finish with gross margin and why it's so
22:37
important not to scale businesses with
22:40
negative gross margins I wrap up with
Final Thoughts
22:42
some final thoughts make sure you're
22:45
tracking your four or five key metrics
22:47
before you launch don't launch without
22:49
metrics in place it's like Flying Blind
22:51
be rigorous in what you track track the
22:54
right metrics don't fall for vanity
22:55
metrics like gross merchandise value
22:58
your impressions or unique users have a
23:01
clear definition of each of your metrics
23:03
and a central way of measuring them in
23:05
your company to avoid those pointless
23:07
arguments that derails meetings don't
23:10
hide behind your metrics you can't split
23:12
everything especially as a small startup
23:14
so a lot of these decisions just have to
23:16
be made by talking to your users and
23:18
using your product intuition you still
23:20
have to get out of the building and talk
23:21
to customers that's so important so I
Outro
23:25
hope that helps run your startup with
23:27
the right blend of metrics talking to
23:30
customers and product intuition those
23:33
three are a vital blend thanks for
