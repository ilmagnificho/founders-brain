good morning I'm Divya and today I'm
0:11
going to talk a little bit about kpis
0:13
and prioritization for an early stage
0:15
startup this is my second batch as a
0:17
visiting group partner here at YC where
0:19
I've worked with hundreds of Founders on
0:21
hitting their demo day goals and
0:22
navigating goal setting and execution as
0:25
they search for product Market fit I
0:27
myself am a two-time YC founder and have
0:29
also held leadership roles at several
0:31
fast growth startups just as a heads up
0:33
I'm going to be giving you some homework
0:35
at the end of this talk my hope is that
0:37
today we can improve the way you spend
0:39
your time and expedite your journey to
0:41
product Market fit so why are we talking
0:43
about this now that you're a startup
0:45
founder there is nobody telling you how
0:47
to spend your time you might have heard
0:48
some version of and not or
0:51
implying that you have to turn over
0:52
every Rock and optimize every metric to
0:55
build a successful startup while this is
0:57
true to some extent you still have to
0:59
choose how you're going to spend your
1:00
time each day ultimately as a startup
1:02
founder you want to get to product
1:03
Market fit as quickly as possible
1:06
prioritization matters and having
1:08
Clarity on your kpis is crucial for
1:10
prioritization let's start by defining
1:12
these terms kpi stands for key
1:15
performance indicator these are the
1:17
metrics that you track and report on
1:19
both internally and externally these
1:21
metrics make sure that you're measuring
1:23
what matters and they tell you whether
1:25
what you're doing is working
1:26
prioritization tells you in what order
1:29
you need to tackle your work each day
1:31
there are infinite things you could be
1:33
doing each day and your work is never
1:35
done but time is finite prioritization
1:38
tells you how you spend your time each
1:40
day how you direct your team to spend
1:43
their time each day when you have one
1:45
and most importantly prioritization
1:47
helps you decide which super important
1:50
things on your list you don't get to
1:52
today here's what your task list may
1:54
look like note that the highlighted
1:56
items in yellow are the ones that I
1:58
might decide to prioritize also note
2:00
that every item on this list feels
2:03
important yet only a few are likely to
2:06
truly move your business forward and
2:08
toward product Market fit in a world
2:10
where you can't possibly get to
2:11
everything you need to prioritize the
2:14
tasks that'll move you to word your kpis
2:16
faster so why are kpis and
2:19
prioritization in one talk well
2:21
prioritization means that you're working
2:23
on the things most likely to impact your
2:26
top kpis so it's critical that you
2:28
choose the right kpis and then are
2:31
honest with yourself about which tasks
2:33
are most likely to move those kpis when
2:35
you're moving fast it's extra important
2:38
to make sure you're running in the right
2:39
direction
2:40
I'll use this analogy a few times today
2:42
so look out for it we come across
2:44
companies all the time who are working
2:46
so hard but optimizing for the wrong
2:49
thing we call these vanity metrics
2:51
things that make you feel good and
2:54
things that you can brag about on
2:55
LinkedIn at the end of the day if you
2:57
fall into the Trap of making these your
2:59
primary kpis you're going to be spending
3:01
your time on the wrong things so why are
3:03
kpis and prioritization important well
3:06
as a Founder no one is going to tell you
3:08
how to spend your time it's very easy to
3:10
feel busy and feel productive and not be
3:12
moving your business forward
3:14
here are some common examples of things
3:16
you can be doing to feel busy today
3:18
optimizing paperwork tasks maybe we're
3:21
good enough is all that you needed
3:22
perfectionism and craft craftsmanship on
3:25
a feature that nobody's using anyway
3:26
premature optimization or building for
3:29
scale that you don't need to yet or
3:31
choosing a more intellectually hard
3:34
problem to solve rather than building
3:35
what your users want I remember in the
3:38
early days of one of my companies we
3:39
were trying to pick a legal firm to work
3:41
with
3:42
sure you need a lawyer and you need to
3:44
need to pick a good lawyer there are so
3:47
many to interview and so many of them
3:48
wanted to take us out to lunch or to
3:50
drinks have us visit their offices The
3:52
Works you guys this felt flattering and
3:54
glamorous we felt so busy but at the end
3:56
of the day we hadn't even launched yeah
3:59
choose a good lawyer no this is not
4:00
impacting your kpis do it quickly and
4:03
move on
4:03
again it's easy to run fast but in the
4:06
wrong direction
4:07
you need to run fast and be running in
4:10
the right direction when you're doing a
4:12
startup time is at a premium
4:15
the faster you get to market the sooner
4:17
you earn money and you can reinvest that
4:19
money in your business and be less
4:21
dependent on outside capital or even if
4:24
you want to keep raising you'll have
4:26
more leverage to raise money on better
4:28
terms taking more time to get to Market
4:30
means you burn more money lastly moving
4:33
slowly means that competitors have more
4:35
time to copy you and catch up time spent
4:38
without making real progress also has an
4:40
emotional and mental cost and can raise
4:43
red flags externally in fundraising and
4:45
hiring so don't waste time on things
How to Prioritize Your Time in the Startup
4:48
that don't matter so let's talk about
4:49
how to prioritize there are two ways we
4:52
can talk about prioritization one is how
4:54
you spend your time on your startup
4:56
versus other things in your life listen
4:58
guys I can't tell you this this is a
4:59
very personal decision this depends on
5:01
what else is going on in your life and
5:03
how you want to spend your time this is
5:05
a whole separate topic that we won't
5:07
spend much time on today that said I
5:09
have two important points one remember
5:11
speed matters and two this is an area
5:15
where it's really important to align
5:16
with your co-founder on expectations
5:18
when we discuss prioritization we mean
5:21
how do you spend the time you've
5:23
allocated to working on your startup
5:24
let's make sure that you're doing the
5:27
most impactful things with your valuable
5:28
time okay so step one for prioritizing
Setting the Right KPI Goals for Prioritization
5:31
we're going to talk more about how to
5:33
set kpis in the next section but I want
5:35
to talk about why this is critical for
5:37
prioritization so first you need to
5:39
identify your top kpis
5:41
if you've launched your primary kpi
5:44
should be Revenue growth if you don't
5:46
want to make Revenue growth your primary
5:48
kpi you need to really push yourself on
5:50
why we talk more about this later in
5:52
this talk but this is important enough
5:54
to mention here a non-revenue kpi is
5:57
rarely the right one and we'll talk
5:59
about a few exceptions later if your
6:01
pre-launch your kpis in the short term
6:03
might be weeks until launch or number of
6:06
conversations with users
6:08
but once you do launch please quickly
6:10
shift your kpis to revenue growth second
6:13
you need to decide what's your kpi goal
6:16
for this week we'll talk about goal
6:18
setting later but assume that you have
6:19
some goal for example 10 more paying
6:22
customers by next week make sure this
6:24
ladders up to any longer term goals that
6:26
you have
6:27
the reason setting the right kpi goals
6:30
is critical is that it'll remind you of
6:32
the urgency of growing fast early growth
6:35
compounds and tracking goals weekly
6:37
reminds you of this here at YC we talk a
6:40
lot about the early days of Airbnb where
6:42
the founding team wrote their weekly kpi
6:45
goals on their bathroom mirror so they
6:47
were facing that reality multiple times
6:49
a day in addition to identifying the
6:51
right kpis you also need to identify
6:54
your biggest bottleneck or problem in
6:56
moving your top kpi here's an example
6:58
from a YC company called super daily a
7:01
daily grocery Subscription Service in
7:03
India that sold to swiggy in 2018. super
7:06
daily faced a scenario early on when
7:08
they launched V1 of their product there
7:11
were a ton of things to be optimized you
7:14
guys picture this business it's
7:15
operationally complex the mobile app Ops
7:18
tooling Inventory management and a whole
7:21
lot of messy on the ground Logistics
7:23
with their North Star was growth and
7:26
they were able to see clearly that their
7:29
bottleneck was the conversion of users
7:31
who actually got pretty far down the
7:33
sign up flow and then churned
7:35
so they asked themselves
7:37
why are high intent users not converting
7:40
that was the biggest problem they needed
7:42
to solve and the first tasks they
7:44
prioritized were conversations and
7:46
experiments to understand this by
7:48
focusing on this question they realized
7:50
that high intent users were dropping out
7:52
because a lot of users wanted a specific
7:55
milk brand that super daily didn't carry
7:58
it wasn't a ux friction issue or an app
8:00
issue so they onboarded that milk brand
8:03
rather than beautifying their sign up
8:04
screen once they solved this then they
8:07
started looking at how to convert users
8:08
that were maybe farther up the funnel or
8:10
lower intent users that were referred by
8:12
word of mouth or people that were
8:13
casually checking out super daily so by
8:16
the time those users got farther down
8:18
the funnel to the highest intent phase
8:20
they now had that top milk brand on the
8:22
app and they knew that they weren't
8:24
optimizing a funnel that would leak
8:26
farther down
8:27
by onboarding this new brand super daily
8:29
was able to increase their conversion
8:31
rate by 50 here's a simple framework to
Simple Framework to Optimize KPI Goal
8:34
prioritize aggressively to optimize for
8:37
that kpi goal number one write down any
8:39
ideas that you might have to hit your
8:41
goals don't start working on them right
8:43
away it's really easy to chase shiny new
8:45
things just write them down next you
8:47
want to rank by probability of success
8:49
and then sub-rank with respect to
8:52
complexity or how long it's going to
8:53
take you to do this task pick only a
8:56
couple of things to try once you pick a
8:57
few tasks and start working on them if
9:00
your kpi isn't moving be really honest
9:02
about why ask why several times until
9:06
you feel like you can actually
9:07
understand the real reason even if it's
9:09
hard to hear per the example of super
9:11
daily earlier it might be something
9:13
simple like the milk brand do Retros in
9:15
your weekly initiatives are you
9:16
predicting impact and complexity well
9:19
did you complete all the tasks you were
9:21
expecting to complete in the Sprint if
9:23
not next time break them down more give
9:26
yourself time blocks to reduce context
9:28
switching or maybe did you accidentally
9:30
work on some of those fake progress
9:32
tasks we talked about just do better
9:34
next time and then move fast learn and
9:37
then do something differently the next
9:39
time if what you did didn't work the
9:41
definition of insanity is doing the same
9:43
thing over and over and expecting
9:45
different results don't let indecision
9:47
slow you down just pick a path and keep
9:49
moving
9:50
ideally you're going to be growing fast
9:52
if not talk to a lot of users fast
9:55
churn through your bad ideas fast so you
9:58
can get to working on the right good
10:00
ideas as fast as possible don't waste
10:03
time on indecision so as a sanity check
5 Things That Should & Should Not End Up on Your Task List
10:05
here are some things that should and
10:08
should not end up on your list in most
10:09
cases since we're talking about the 90
10:12
case here and specifically talking about
10:15
early stage startups here are a list of
10:17
example tasks that you should see on
10:20
your task list
10:21
talking to users
10:23
and then building and iterating based on
10:25
user feedback when you're spending time
10:27
talking to your customers and responding
10:29
to support emails there is a direct path
10:33
to revenue growth the only way you know
10:36
what your customers want is by talking
10:38
to them all the time and the only way to
10:40
grow is by building something people
10:42
want not much else is going to help you
10:44
at this stage here are some things that
10:46
should not end up on your task list AKA
10:48
fake progress
10:50
passive fundraising conversations or
10:52
coffees when you aren't actively raising
10:54
when you do decide to raise it should be
10:56
deliberate focused and time boxed
10:58
conference attendances other than a few
11:00
select Industries this generally won't
11:02
move your needle in an early stage third
11:05
arbitrary technical Milestones spending
11:07
time optimizing technical benchmarks
11:10
launching an Android app unless you're
11:12
hearing clearly from your users that
11:14
this is a burning pain point this is
11:17
probably fake progress at this point you
11:19
guys this fake progress list it's not
11:21
anything to be ashamed about
11:23
smart people put these things on their
11:25
list all the time we've all done it
11:27
these are all tasks that can make you
11:29
feel good they boost your ego their
11:31
metrics that you can brag about on
11:33
LinkedIn they might make your mom proud
11:35
they might make your ex-boyfriend
11:36
jealous but what they don't do is they
11:39
don't necessarily get you closer to
11:40
product Market fit here are some common
11:42
tricks your brain plays on you when
11:44
you're trying to prioritize
11:46
these are tricks and traps that your
11:48
mind has to help you avoid negative
11:50
feelings like shame despair
11:53
embarrassment self-doubt many people are
11:56
drawn to low leverage tasks why they
11:59
provide a sense of accomplishment they
12:01
allow you to check things off your list
12:03
and it's so tangible at a time when your
12:05
startup's future is uncertain there can
12:07
be so much satisfaction in checking
12:09
tasks off a list don't fall into this
12:12
trap here are some examples of this
12:14
spending too much time optimizing
12:16
paperwork or unlicensing incorporation
12:18
Equity this is not an area where you
12:22
need to optimize or innovate just follow
12:24
the standard advice to stay legal and
12:26
compliant slightly cheaper workers comp
12:28
insurance or slightly better Equity
12:30
structure is not going to make or break
12:32
your business taking meetings with
12:34
potential investors advisors Partners or
12:37
building cool hard features that you
12:39
don't know people want yet again these
12:42
things can make you feel really good and
12:43
really smart solving hard problems is
12:45
awesome unfortunately it's not going to
12:47
help you find product Market fit sooner
12:49
it's just going to be things you're
12:50
checking off a list the second mental
12:52
trap I want to talk about is that
12:54
sometimes you can fool yourself into
12:55
thinking something is working when it's
12:57
really not be honest with yourself it
13:00
doesn't feel good to admit to yourself
13:02
or your teammates or your investors or
13:05
your mom the things aren't going well
13:07
but you're not doing yourself any favors
13:10
by not diagnosing problems early and
13:12
often slow growth can be deceptive it's
13:15
easy to mistake slow growth for product
13:17
Market fit as someone that's worked at
13:20
both kind of slow steady growth
13:21
companies my own startups and companies
13:23
with clear product Market fit like
13:25
doordash trust me you guys these types
13:28
of growth feel fundamentally different
13:30
third trap I want to talk about is
13:32
perfectionism or indecision blocking
13:35
progress when nothing seems to be
13:37
working it's really easy to make every
13:39
decision feel like it's going to make or
13:41
break your company in reality
13:44
most decisions don't matter and for the
13:46
ones that do it's okay to decide wrong
13:49
first and then fix it later just keep
13:52
moving so the best case scenario you
13:54
know the one you can put on a pedestal
13:56
is a scenario where you make the right
13:57
decision quickly every time this is
14:00
completely impossible no one's going to
14:01
achieve this I recommend the second best
14:04
option which is to make pretty good
14:06
decisions quickly and then if they turn
14:08
out to be wrong fail learn and switch to
14:11
what's working quickly as a startup
14:14
founder you have dozens of decisions to
14:16
make every day
14:17
don't waste time on the ones that won't
14:19
help you get to product Market fit
14:20
remember if it's a tough call it
14:23
actually probably means you can't go
14:24
wrong
14:25
so pick one keep moving the fourth
14:28
mental trap I want to talk about is
14:29
spending too much time on downside
14:32
protection instead of chasing upside
14:34
downside protection is straightforward
14:36
and satisfying fixing little problems is
14:39
very easy but rarely where the
14:42
Innovation happens chasing upside
14:44
requires risk taking creativity a lot of
14:47
false starts so get in as many
14:49
iterations as you can for example we
14:52
hear a lot of Ops teams talking about
14:54
getting themselves out of spreadsheets
14:55
y'all at this stage spreadsheets are
14:58
fine until they're not if they're
14:59
working stick with them it's good to do
15:02
things that don't scale as long as
15:04
they're not breaking instead spend your
15:06
time finding out what your users need in
15:09
order to use your product every day
15:11
instead of once a week that's the upside
15:13
chasing that we're talking about the
15:15
last trap I want to call out today is
15:17
chipping away at small problems when
15:19
there's a big existential one looming
15:21
that maybe you don't want to face for
15:23
example you may tell yourself hey okay
15:25
my 150 users are asking for one click
15:28
ordering let me go build it you guys you
15:30
only have 150 users this is a problem
15:32
maybe you've only had 150 users for the
15:35
past three months and they're starting
15:36
to churn and no one knew is signing up
15:38
that's your biggest problem go solve
15:40
that so here's a quick recap on
15:42
prioritization you'll never get to
15:44
everything on your task list
15:46
you have to use kpis to prioritize your
15:49
work and only work on the biggest
15:51
blocker to your primary kpi and be
15:53
honest with yourself and fail fast so
Choosing the Right KPIs for your Startup
15:56
now let's talk about how to choose the
15:58
right kpis remember we can't afford to
16:01
waste time running fast in the wrong
16:02
direction let's define primary and
16:05
secondary kpis your primary kpi or
16:07
primary metric is the main metric you
16:10
use to measure whether your business is
16:13
on track for the vast majority of
16:15
startups your primary kpi should be
16:17
growth and ideally Revenue growth this
16:19
indicates that you've built something
16:21
people want and you're on track to
16:23
building a huge business as we've
16:25
mentioned there are a few exceptions to
16:27
this for example maybe a Marketplace
16:29
business might choose signups or gmv as
16:32
their primary kpi or an early Enterprise
16:34
business with a long sales cycle might
16:36
choose letters of intent secondary kpis
16:39
are things that need to be tracked
16:41
moving in the right direction to make
16:42
sure you're not cheating on your primary
16:44
kpi or to give you an early signal when
16:47
your primary kpi is very lagging here
16:49
are some examples of secondary kpis
16:50
retention and churn these are going to
16:53
actually contribute to your Revenue
16:54
growth so they're very important to
16:56
track unit economics you need to make
16:58
sure you're making money on each user
17:00
and not giving away free money and
17:02
calling it growth customer acquisition
17:04
cost depending on your stage you may not
17:07
need to optimize this right now just
17:09
have a sense for your payback period and
17:11
whether you'll make or lose money per
17:12
customer acquired keep this list small
17:15
and relevant three to five secondary
17:17
kpis is reasonable I've also included a
17:19
short list here of vanity metrics as we
17:22
discussed earlier it is very easy even
17:25
for good Founders to fall into the Trap
17:28
of prioritizing for these metrics they
17:30
feel good and they provide external
17:33
validation
17:34
you find these creeping into your task
17:36
list just ask yourself
17:38
is this directly on my path to revenue
17:40
growth is this my biggest blocker to
17:43
illustrate what a laser focus on growth
17:45
looks like I dug up some examples here's
17:48
a side by side comparison of doordash on
17:51
demo day which everyone knows and my own
17:53
startup Rickshaw which was also a
17:55
delivery platform we went through YC
17:58
right after doordash did and doordash
18:00
eventually acquired Rickshaw in 2017.
18:03
both companies had a laser focus on
18:05
order volume as a Top Line metric this
18:08
allowed for Clear focused execution and
18:11
resulted in strong and very similar
18:13
early traction however post demo day the
18:17
paths diverged a little bit Rickshaw had
18:19
a bit of trouble fundraising despite
18:21
comparable early attraction to doordash
18:23
this caused us to make a decision out of
18:26
fear and instead of continuing to have a
18:28
clear focus on Top Line growth as
18:30
doordash did we tried to optimize for
18:33
both growth and unit economics we tried
18:36
to hedge and this was very dangerous
18:38
this split Focus put us in a weird no
18:41
man's land of slow growth which as we
18:43
described before can kill startups there
18:46
is a lot more Nuance about profitability
18:48
versus growth that I won't get into here
18:50
the main message today is to choose your
18:53
primary kpis and don't try to get smart
18:55
and optimize for two or more hard things
How to Set Targets
18:58
at once so now that we've talked about
19:00
how to define primary and secondary kpis
19:02
how do we set targets assuming growth is
19:05
your primary kpi how much growth is
19:08
enough this depends on your business and
19:10
your stage but in Paul Graham's classic
19:13
essay about growth she notes that for a
19:16
company going through YC
19:17
five to seven percent week over week is
19:20
growth is good and a ten percent week
19:22
over week growth is exceptional
19:25
as I've said a few times now small
19:27
changes in weekly or monthly growth
19:29
growth rate really compound and make a
19:32
difference in the long run so early
19:34
growth is better than late growth if you
19:36
can choose that number on your bathroom
19:38
mirror per the Airbnb story reminds you
19:41
to focus on this early
19:43
here are a few factors that might impact
19:45
your growth rate that you might want to
19:46
keep in mind
19:48
first latent demand might boost early
19:51
growth perhaps some early users will be
19:53
willing to put up with an inferior
19:55
product experience because you're
19:57
solving an urgent need
19:59
but that growth rate might be tougher to
20:01
sustain later
20:03
for Enterprise businesses the length of
20:05
your sales cycle might be long this
20:07
should go up down over time but it might
20:10
impact early kpi and goal setting in
20:13
these cases you can set goals around
20:15
other process metrics for example leads
20:17
in different stages of your funnel
20:19
another thing that might be impacting
20:20
your growth rate is whether you're doing
20:22
organic or paid user acquisition
20:25
early on organic is ideal you should
20:29
know where to find your first few
20:31
passionate users and talk to them
20:32
directly and ideally have them spread
20:35
the word
20:36
you can also run paid acquisition tests
20:38
so that once you have a product that's
20:40
growing organically and a sense for
20:42
payback period you can crank out the ads
20:44
crank up the ad spend to drive growth
20:46
but please don't do this too early and
20:49
don't leak money on this strategy
20:51
accidentally the last thing I want to
20:53
talk about on the slide is retention and
20:55
engagement
20:56
we get a common question should we focus
20:58
on getting new users or focused on
21:01
retaining our existing users
21:03
the short answer to this is you have to
21:05
do both the slightly longer nuanced
21:08
answer is that both will impact your
21:10
Revenue growth so get a sense for which
21:12
one's going to have more impact first
21:14
make sure you don't have a problem with
21:16
churn and that your users are sticking
21:19
around long enough to pay back their
21:21
acquisition cost and to tell their
21:22
friends
21:23
you don't want to bring new customers
21:25
into a substandard product
21:27
but beyond that of course focus on
21:30
bringing in new users ultimately both
21:33
these metrics will need to be strong to
21:35
sustain a healthy Revenue growth to
21:38
share another example from Super daily
21:40
early on they realized that the
21:42
acquisition numbers they were tracking
21:44
were not reflecting a healthy growing
21:46
business and could be artificially
21:48
boosted due to paid promos to protect
21:51
against this they switched their track
21:53
metric from sign ups which was too easy
21:56
to game to tracking customers who who'd
21:59
placed five or more orders since they
22:01
saw this as a leading indicator to
22:03
customers that were very likely to
22:05
become long-term Revenue generating
22:07
customers this helped the super daily
22:09
teams align their marketing and their
22:11
overall Revenue goals to chase top line
22:13
revenue growth when setting targets
Setting Targets - Top Down & Bottom Up
22:15
there are two possible approaches and
22:17
you can and actually should do both your
22:20
first option is a top-down approach set
22:23
a goal or a milestone that you need to
22:24
reach sometime in the future for example
22:26
five thousand dollars in mrr by the end
22:29
of startup School
22:30
back into that Weekly growth rate that
22:33
you need to achieve to achieve that
22:34
longer term goal the Airbnb demo day
22:37
example is a great example of this set a
22:40
Target and obsess over it compounding
22:43
matters so getting an early start helps
22:46
a lot your second option is a Bottoms Up
22:48
approach ask yourself what do you think
22:51
is realistic for you to get done in the
22:53
next week
22:54
then you can project out from there as a
22:57
thought exercise when doing a Bottoms Up
22:59
goal setting you can ask yourself what
23:02
could we achieve with unlimited funding
23:04
a lot of people in their heads think
23:06
that funding is a bottleneck so let's
23:07
remove that what could we do in the next
23:10
week with unlimited money or resources
23:12
then ask yourself what creative ways can
23:15
we still achieve that even with limited
23:17
funding
23:19
set your goal between top down and
23:21
bottom up
23:22
either is actually fine I recommend
23:24
periodically doing both to see whether
23:26
what you're doing is realistic
23:27
achievable and ambitious at the same
23:30
time just make sure that you're checking
23:32
to make sure that you're always on track
23:34
to build a big business and aren't
23:36
accidentally ending up in that no man's
23:38
land of underwhelming but consistent
23:40
growth let's talk a little bit more
23:42
about some non-revenue kpis that may be
23:44
tempting but not always right first
23:47
CAC to LTV ratio
23:50
you might hear these buzzwords together
23:52
these are generally concerns kind of
23:56
later in your business but they usually
23:59
come post product Market fit once you
24:01
have a fundamental business that you
24:03
know people want and then you need to
24:04
reliably scale your user base
24:07
so for now we recommend you only worry
24:09
about payback period
24:11
ideally your payback period is zero as
24:14
in zero dollars spent on CAC so
24:16
customers are profitable on day one
24:19
if you do need to spend on CAC or unpaid
24:21
acquisition get a sense for how quickly
24:24
users pay back that CAC and whether
24:26
you're reliably hitting it does your
24:28
retention rate make this work
24:31
LTV can really be a rabbit hole for
24:33
early stage companies and it's really
24:35
hard to calculate so just make sure your
24:37
payback period is reasonable and you're
24:39
making money per user a second tempting
24:42
kpi I want to talk about is free sign
24:44
ups or daily active users
24:47
I'll start by saying this
24:48
paying customers will have very
24:51
different expectations for a product
24:52
than for than free customers will so if
24:55
you plan to charge for your product
24:57
eventually don't mess around getting
24:59
feedback from free customers it'll
25:01
likely be the wrong feedback
25:03
get paid from day one or at least don't
25:05
count those users as part of your growth
25:07
the main exception here is from
25:10
marketplaces or products that have a
25:12
strong Network effect and need volume in
25:14
order to have utility Uber is a great
25:17
example of this without enough drivers
25:19
on the platform the user experience was
25:21
not good enough for writers to pay a
25:23
premium for in these cases sign ups or
25:26
gmv can sometimes suffice if no revenue
25:29
is being generated yet I have a couple
25:31
of stories of startups spending too much
25:34
time on sign ups and shifting to revenue
25:36
too late in the game Scribd was an early
25:39
YC company that went through in summer
25:41
2006.
25:42
they spent their first four years
25:44
primarily growing a free product and
25:47
they were afraid of losing their
25:49
millions of customers if they started
25:51
charging as you can see in this graph in
25:53
year five so remember they started in
25:55
2006 in mid-2010 they started charging
25:58
and while they did lose over 90 percent
26:01
of their customers their revenue grew by
26:04
Infinity percent they finally had a
26:05
business and while Scribd already had
26:07
millions of users it wasn't until they
26:10
started charging that they started to
26:12
really learn what their paying users
26:14
wanted I want to quickly talk about a
Exceptions To Revenue KPIs: Hard Tech
26:17
few exceptions other exceptions to
26:19
revenue kpis and this is hardware
26:21
companies biotech companies Enterprise
26:23
businesses with a long long sales cycle
26:26
and these businesses it can be more
26:28
challenging to measure growth and in
26:30
these cases something like letters of
26:32
intent contracts maybe even technical
26:34
Milestones might be reasonable metrics
26:37
but please keep yourself honest and make
26:41
sure that these are actually indicators
26:43
of actual progress and growth and audit
26:45
them frequently now I challenge each of
26:47
you at the end of this talk you should
26:49
each write down your primary and
26:51
secondary kpis and set ambitious targets
26:54
next audit your task list for the week
26:58
and make sure you are laser focused on
27:00
hitting those goals I know a lot of you
27:02
are in slack and WhatsApp groups for
27:04
startup school I encourage you to share
27:06
your kpis and your goals with your
27:08
community and get feedback and hold
27:10
yourselves accountable I hope this talk
27:12
helps at least one of you get to product
27:14
Market fit faster
