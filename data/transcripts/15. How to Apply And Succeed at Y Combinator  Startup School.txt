How to Apply And Succeed at Y Combinator  Startup School

YC Group Partner Dalton Caldwell shares his strategies for how to think about applying to YC. This talk goes beyond the information on YC's website, and reflects Dalton's latest advice on the topic. (Fun Fact: An earlier version of this talk is frequently mentioned by YC founders as instrumental in their decision to apply to YC and to getting in!)

Intro
0:01
[Music]
0:08
hey everybody this is Dalton I am
0:11
excited to talk to you today topic of
0:13
today's talk is how to apply and succeed
0:16
at y a combinator so to begin with let's
Why It's Worth Applying to YC
0:18
talk about why it's worth applying to Y
0:20
combinator it's a good idea to sit down
0:22
and think about your startup this is
0:24
Evergreen advice regardless of IC and so
0:27
going through and answering the
0:28
application questions
0:30
um to organize and clarify your thinking
0:31
super helpful right go look at the
0:34
questions
0:35
um it'll help you think about your own
0:36
business and maybe find some edge cases
0:38
and so I think that's worth doing for
0:40
everybody in addition if you're sitting
0:42
there watching this presentation the
0:45
odds uh that YC is good fit for you is
0:47
pretty good and then let's talk about
0:49
the cost benefit analysis of applying to
0:51
YC we very intentionally designed the
0:54
application to be fast and easy to fill
0:57
out and so the the downside is you apply
1:01
and you don't don't get in but you only
1:03
spend a tiny bit of time doing it versus
1:05
the potential upside being very big man
1:07
that's that's a pretty good trade-off
1:08
and so those are all some reasons why
1:10
it's worth applying to YC I want to talk
Creating Luck
1:12
about luck a little bit um I've spoken
1:14
about this in past YC talks and I've
1:16
noticed a lot of applicants that have
1:18
gotten into YC referenced this talk that
1:20
I gave years ago so I want to remind you
1:21
all of kind of My Philosophy about
1:23
creating luck certain people are luckier
1:26
than others but one of the ways you can
1:28
create luck and become luckier is to put
1:30
yourself out there more to create this
1:33
luck you need to take risks
1:35
you can systematically put yourself out
1:38
there
1:39
to be in situations where good things
1:41
can happen to you or surprising upside
1:43
things can happen to you on the flip
1:45
side if you avoid situations where you
1:47
face rejection like applying to YC
1:49
you're reducing the surface area to get
1:52
lucky and so I think this is pretty good
1:55
Evergreen advice regardless of what
1:57
you're doing which is if you're looking
1:59
for a startup idea if you're trying to
2:00
learn how to do sales if you're trying
2:02
to recruit great employees you want to
2:04
put yourself out there and take risks
2:07
you want to try a lot of different stuff
2:08
and the more you can develop this luck
2:10
creation skill the better and deciding
2:13
to apply apply to YC itself is a way to
2:15
great luck I also want to go through a
Weird Reasons Not to Apply to YC
2:17
lot of the weird reasons people come up
2:20
with not to apply to IC again I've
2:22
talked to lots of Founders and so these
2:23
are all coming
2:24
um from many conversations I've had in
2:26
person with folks first off I am too
I Am Too Early
2:29
early this is a very common one if you
2:31
look at the history of great YC
2:33
companies that have gotten in many of
2:34
them
2:36
pivoted after they got in and so if
2:37
that's not too early I don't know what
2:39
is many folks haven't quit their job
2:41
they get into YC they haven't written
2:43
any code
2:44
um there's there's honestly no such
2:46
thing as too early
2:48
um and so I would not count that as a
2:50
valid reason next I am too far along the
2:53
flip side of I'm too early
2:55
um this one we hear a lot again it's
2:57
it's pretty funny because we have folks
2:59
that get into YC that have I don't know
3:01
half a million dollars in annual
3:02
recurring Revenue also a common one here
3:05
these days is oh I'm too far along
3:06
because I've already raised some money
3:07
we have folks that apply and get
3:09
accepted to YC that have raised
3:11
literally a million dollars
3:13
um often more depending on uh their
3:16
specific situation and so if you don't
3:19
have product Market fit as per the other
3:21
talks you've heard here there's a good
3:23
chance that you are not too far along
3:24
from YC and much of the help we can give
3:27
you is to kind of zero in on and focus
3:30
on finding product Market fit all right
3:32
and so I wouldn't say to yourself well
3:33
I'm too far along for YC
3:35
um I doubt it next this is kind of a new
Being a YC founder is different than watching YC YouTube videos
3:37
one a lot of folks have seen our videos
3:39
like this one and they think this is
3:41
like a reasonable approximation of being
3:43
an NYC that is not the case so let me
3:46
just run through a few of these uh
3:48
reasons why being a real YC founder is
3:51
different than watching these videos
3:53
first off we are real people believe it
3:56
or not yeah
3:57
um and by being in the batch you get our
3:59
full attention you get real-time access
4:01
to us we text with people all the time
4:03
and you get to know us in person very
4:05
different experience and so you get
4:07
these one-on-one office hours with your
4:08
group Partners folks like me and I'll
4:11
tell you a secret there's tons of
4:12
Secrets we tell you that we would never
4:15
say on the internet we have to be you
4:18
know we're careful about what things we
4:19
say in this format and there's a whole
4:21
breadth and depth of knowledge that you
4:23
will only hear if you're NYC in addition
4:25
there's a bunch of internal tools for
4:27
Founders inside of YC work at a startup
4:29
all of our proprietary fundraising data
4:31
and tools our series a fundraising tools
4:35
etc etc so so there's lots of stuff that
4:37
go on behind the scenes it could not be
4:39
more different than watching some videos
4:40
on the internet another one that comes
How to Stop Being Discouraged From Applying to YC
4:42
up a lot is a potential applicant is
4:45
discouraged by someone in their life
4:46
someone is trying to play the role of
4:48
gatekeeper and that person is saying oh
4:50
don't apply to YC you know and then
4:52
there's a there's a few different
4:53
reasons why they may say that you could
4:55
ask someone that's saying oh don't apply
4:57
to IC some of these questions hey so
4:59
you're saying I shouldn't spend a few
5:01
minutes filling out this application and
5:02
applying to maybe getting in and I get
5:04
half a million dollars up front and so
5:06
if it's an investor discouraging you you
5:08
should ask the investor oh so are you
5:10
going to invest on what terms are you
5:12
going to invest this is again this is a
5:14
tip for you because if the investor is
5:16
not willing to invest themselves they're
5:17
simply saying they don't want to see you
5:19
raise but they themselves are not going
5:21
to invest you can call them out on that
5:23
next sometimes folks are in some Market
5:27
or some City or somewhere
5:29
um and there's there's folks saying you
5:32
know stay small stay in this country
5:33
stay in the city don't think of this on
5:35
a global scale YC's too big it's too far
5:38
away and again I we fund people from all
5:41
over the world from every city from
5:43
every country and you want to ask them
5:45
if if they're discouraging you from
5:47
actually dreaming as big as you can
5:48
dream because sometimes they are and I
5:51
don't think that's great and then
5:52
finally sometimes folks uh suggest not
5:54
applying because some other theoretical
5:56
thing might happen like maybe you'll do
5:58
this maybe you'll raise a series a maybe
5:59
you'll raise a seed round and again I
6:02
want you to think about asking the
6:03
person
6:04
are you discouraging me from seizing an
6:06
opportunity right in front of me for
6:08
some theoretical thing that might happen
6:11
and I think you'll you'll kind of see
6:12
where they're coming from so anyway I
6:14
think these are questions you can ask
6:15
someone that's discouraging you from
6:17
applying to YC and again maybe they'll
6:19
have something good to say maybe they'll
6:20
want to invest I don't know next up a
Other Reasons Why People Don't Apply to YC
6:22
few other reasons people sometimes don't
6:23
apply one they think their company is
6:25
too different or unique for YC to
6:27
understand again if you look at our top
6:29
companies list you'll see we fund
6:31
companies in every vertical from every
6:32
country and so again I I doubt it
6:35
sometimes people are based on a location
6:37
and they're not sure if we fund people
6:39
in that location I assure you we do if
6:43
you look at all the countries
6:44
um for companies we fund we fund them
6:46
all over
6:47
sometimes people are worried that we
6:48
funded a startup in the same space it's
6:50
pretty common especially if it's a great
6:52
startup idea to have multiple companies
6:54
in the same space and so we don't hold
6:56
that against someone okay and then
6:58
finally people that have applied before
7:01
um are upset about it and don't want to
7:03
apply again because they fell they feel
7:05
upset about not applying again I we're
7:07
going to talk about this more later but
7:09
I can't stress enough that it's actually
7:10
a plus to have applied multiple times
7:14
um and not a negative and so look don't
7:15
let that hold you back I think my last
Don't Overthink
7:17
point on this section is is a simple
7:19
piece of advice don't overthink this
7:21
just like anything with your startup
7:23
don't overthink the decisions if
7:25
something seems like it might be a good
7:26
idea give it a shot it's as simple as
7:28
that and we see a lot of people with
7:29
these really complex ideas about the
7:31
best time to apply to YC or when to
7:33
apply to yce or what startup ideas to
7:35
apply to IC with you know don't
7:36
overthink this certainly not conducive
7:39
with folks we've seen build big
7:40
companies and look a lot of the reason
7:42
people don't apply to ycee is because
7:45
they're pretty confident they won't get
7:47
it fair I would just suggest to everyone
7:51
get used to doing things that you think
7:54
probably won't work and get comfortable
7:57
being uncomfortable in this way I think
7:59
it's a really good lesson to set
8:01
yourself up to do things that are kind
8:03
of a long shot and the fact is most of
8:06
the folks in the most recent YC batches
8:08
are not first-time applicants there's
8:11
some folks that applied five times six
8:13
times seven times those folks had
8:14
persistence they showed character and it
8:16
worked for them and so uses just is just
8:19
one little lesson on not being afraid of
8:23
doing something you think has a
8:24
relatively low odds of success here's a
8:26
few good reasons not to apply to IC uh
8:28
one is you don't want to work on the
8:30
company for very long say you want to
8:32
just work on it for the summer or six
8:34
months and then go get a job okay yeah
8:36
you know don't don't apply another one
8:38
is if you don't think Venture uh capital
8:41
is a good route to take all right that's
8:43
fair I mean because because YC investing
8:45
is a form of venture capital right and
8:47
so if you don't want to pursue that type
8:49
of business probably a good reason not
8:50
to apply and then also if your business
8:52
is not a technology startup say it's
8:55
more of a traditional business where
8:57
there's no technical component there's
8:59
no programming there's no biotechnology
9:01
okay that's probably a good reason not
9:02
to apply that's not really
9:04
um our sweet spot let's shift gears and
YC's Application Tips
9:06
let's talk about the application and let
9:08
me give you some tips for your YC
9:09
application first off you apply on our
9:12
website you don't need permission you
9:15
don't need to email us you don't need to
9:17
send us a deck you just apply on our
9:19
website it really is that simple let me
9:22
give you some tips on your application
9:23
first fill the whole thing out fill out
9:26
the founder biographies a lot of the
9:28
worst applications say worse but the
9:30
ones that are just not strong the
9:32
founders did not take the time to fill
9:33
them out okay that's obviously someone
9:36
that didn't put much effort in and so
9:38
actually fill it out pay attention to
9:40
little things like grammar punctuation
9:42
capitalization little stuff like that if
9:45
you don't if you don't do it certainly
9:47
shows to us that you may not be that
9:48
serious about applying to YC so do that
9:50
stuff make a Founder video that follows
9:52
directions we put directions on how to
9:55
do the video sometimes people don't
9:57
follow the directions for whatever
9:58
reason and I just want to give you a
10:00
little tip our entire application
10:02
process has these detailed instructions
10:04
and we definitely take into account if
10:07
you follow them in our selection
10:09
criteria this is one of the ways to tell
10:11
how detail-oriented someone is if they
10:14
just follow directions and So Pro tip
10:16
read all the stuff follow the directions
10:18
we definitely weigh that in our decision
10:20
next your written answers should be
10:22
clear and concise don't write a novel
10:26
more words is not better right you don't
10:30
get bonus points for writing something
10:32
that's so long we can't scroll down the
10:33
screen be clear be concise answer the
10:36
question directly let me talk to you
YC Application Reviewing: The Basics
10:37
about what it's like to be on our side
10:40
of the table someone that reads
10:41
applications and so here are the
10:43
questions that I ask myself when I'm
10:45
reviewing someone's YC application first
10:47
off who are the founders what's their
10:49
backstory how do they come together how
10:51
do they know each other who on the team
10:53
is doing what okay I ask myself that
10:56
next what is their idea what are they
10:58
working on
10:59
um do I understand what they're doing
11:01
does it seem interesting have I heard
11:02
this before what exactly do they have
11:05
today right today at this moment in time
11:09
is it built are there users
11:12
um I really want to know what the
11:13
current state of the union is on the
11:15
product
11:16
in addition is there any evidence that
11:18
people want this they have customers
11:20
they have users um are they using their
11:22
own product in addition is there
11:23
evidence that the founders are serious
11:25
and serious in this in this sense is the
11:28
following that they really want to do a
11:30
startup
11:31
right for instance if someone has left
11:32
their job to work on this full-time
11:34
that's an Evidence of seriousness if
11:36
someone has applied multiple times and
11:38
every time they apply
11:39
they make more progress that's evidence
11:41
of seriousness you see what I'm saying
11:43
like it's it's trying to get the sense
11:46
if they're just throwing in the
11:47
application with
11:49
for fun or if they really are serious
11:52
about doing a startup and then finally
11:54
um I look for what's impressive or
11:55
unique or special about the application
11:57
this could be different things sometimes
11:58
the founders are unique sometimes the
12:01
traction is unique sometimes the ideas
12:02
and idea I've never heard before and so
12:04
I really look for something that really
12:05
stands out about the application what I
12:08
do with this data that I just told you
12:09
that I read is an application reader is
12:11
I tell myself a little story and so I
12:14
might say something again this is all my
12:16
head but I might say something like oh
12:17
this is the story of two friends we're
12:19
both programmers working on
12:20
infrastructure at Facebook and they quit
12:22
their jobs three months ago to build a
12:23
new Cloud hosting company they built a
12:25
basic demo and have one first customer
12:27
and that customer is using it on this
12:28
website and I can go look at the website
12:30
and our plan has become the top hosting
12:32
company for all react apps great do you
12:34
see how that's a story it has characters
12:35
it has a beginning it has an end I
12:37
understand what's going on
12:39
um if I can tell this kind of story
12:40
about your company by reading your
12:41
application it means it was a good
12:43
application on the flip side
12:45
weak applications obfuscate everything
12:49
and so I as a reader can't tell what's
12:51
going on I don't understand what the
12:53
idea actually is I don't understand the
12:55
back story like why do these people know
12:57
each other how do they meet I can't tell
12:59
if they built it
13:01
I have no idea you know I can't see a
13:03
demo maybe it's built I don't know I
13:05
can't tell if they have customers they
13:07
might have customers but I can't
13:09
actually tell and so it's basically
13:10
impossible for me to tell a story about
13:12
you because I don't even understand the
13:14
basics to me this is actually a deep
13:16
tourism for all aspects of your startup
13:18
which is if I can't even understand
13:22
basics of what you're trying to
13:24
communicate to me you're not even the
13:26
ball in the ballpark of convincing me
13:28
right like if I don't even know if I
13:31
can't parse what you're trying to say
13:32
the odds of you convincing someone is
13:35
basically zero and so you want to really
13:38
make sure people understand the basics
13:40
here's an example that I threw up
13:42
there's a company called gitlab it's
13:43
publicly traded you can go buy their
13:44
stock it's a multi-billion dollar
13:47
company this is from their YC
13:49
application I just pulled it off to give
13:51
you an example of what a clear
13:52
description is do you see they're very
13:54
concrete about what it is what it does
13:56
who uses it they say a hundred thousand
13:59
organizations use it they say
14:00
programmers Apple use it this is really
14:02
well done so me as a reader reading this
14:04
Crystal Clear what gitlap is great
14:07
application and look they did it in just
14:09
a few sentences very well done here is a
14:11
fake thing that I wrote because I don't
14:13
want to shame anyone
14:14
and I I put this together I don't even
14:17
know if this is really exaggerated these
14:19
are these are the kinds of things I read
14:20
in applications sometimes where there
14:22
are words here the words say things
14:24
there's there's words I recognize but if
14:27
you ask me to summarize what these three
14:30
or four sentences are and tell a story
14:32
about what you do or what it is or how
14:34
it's different I would not be able to
14:35
tell you this just turns my brain off so
14:38
there you go please don't submit stuff
14:40
like this
14:41
I still don't know what they do I wrote
14:43
this and I have no idea what this is
14:44
okay let me give you some other tips our
14:47
entire system rewards honest people
14:49
acting in good faith if there's some
14:52
hint somewhere in your application or
14:54
elsewhere that you are being misleading
14:56
in your answers your application will be
14:58
rejected uh we're sympathetic to honest
15:01
mistakes but anyone that's doing
15:03
intentional obfuscation or
15:05
misrepresentation of things in their
15:07
application like revenue or traction
15:09
your founder background your educational
15:12
history you name it that just that's
15:13
disqualifying you know it's pretty
15:15
common to see people kind of try to
15:17
misrepresent revenue or make it look
15:19
like it's monthly revenue is really
15:21
annual revenue so just don't do things
15:24
like this we notice and we really
15:27
um don't like it as an application
15:30
reader this is like automatic
15:32
disqualification okay in addition I want
15:35
you all to understand extraordinary
15:36
claims on your application require
15:38
extraordinary evidence and so if your
15:40
claim are hey we have no users cool like
15:43
there's not a lot of evidence you would
15:45
need to show there but if you want to
15:47
argue that some big impressive company
15:49
is one of your customers you should be
15:51
prepared to back that up or demonstrate
15:53
that they are actually one of your
15:54
customers shouldn't be a problem in the
15:56
case of gitlab it wasn't a problem for
15:57
them to demonstrate who their customers
15:58
were next a lot of people ask questions
What Are Your Odds of Getting an Interview at YC?
16:00
around what their odds are of getting an
16:03
interview at ycee it's very hard to
16:05
answer this question but I'm gonna do my
16:06
best because it gets asked so much
16:08
probably the biggest variable
16:11
for if someone is selected for interview
16:13
is the quality and quantity of the
16:16
technical Talent on the founding team so
16:19
if there is a team that's applying or at
16:21
least one of the of the founders is it a
16:24
skill set level to be hired into a
16:26
technical role at a top YC company they
16:28
have 5x better odds than teams that
16:31
don't and quick note on this internships
16:33
are okay so say you're an intern at
16:35
stripe or Airbnb or a place like that
16:38
okay that counts and so it's very
16:41
helpful to have technical Talent on the
16:42
founding team and this this includes
16:44
biotech hard tech things like that right
16:46
this isn't just software but
16:48
definitely something we look at and then
16:50
as per this talk we did earlier in
16:52
startup School dispatch about tar pit
16:54
ideas teams where there aren't technical
16:56
Founders and they're working on an
16:58
unlaunched tarpet idea those folks have
17:01
the lowest odds that's a fact how can
17:02
you improve your odds of getting an
17:04
interview well first off add technical
17:06
talent to the team and so this is why we
17:08
have co-founder matching there's a
17:10
number of folks even in the current
17:11
batch that met via co-founder matching
17:13
and it works we love it what a great way
17:15
to add technical talent to your team
17:16
hooray quick note on this the entire YC
17:21
model
17:22
was built to not require networking we
17:25
don't want warm intros we don't want
17:27
pitch decks we don't want to hop on a
17:30
quick call that is not how YC Works in
17:33
our funding decisions we built a system
17:35
that is optimized for funding complete
17:38
strangers that fill out a form on our
17:40
website there's no tricks here it really
17:43
is that simple and if you ask alumni the
17:45
folks that I found are complete
17:47
strangers that I have not met before so
17:49
beware of folks out in the world that
17:51
claim they can help you get into YC they
17:53
claim they're connected with some other
17:55
investors and they want something they
17:57
want Equity they want money they're
17:59
basically scammers and so you should be
18:01
aware that there's lots of folks out
18:03
there in startup ecosystems that kind of
18:05
victimize aspiring Founders giving these
18:08
kinds of people Equity or whatever in
18:10
your company does not help you get into
18:11
YC I'm sorry let's talk about the
How to Prepare for Your YC Interview
18:13
interview let me give you some interview
18:15
tips and preparation how do YC
18:17
interviews work if you're selected for
18:19
interviews after applying there's just a
18:21
10 minute Zoom call with us we expect
18:24
all the founders on your side to be
18:25
there there's usually two to four folks
18:28
from YC on the call on our side
18:30
and you should assume during the
18:31
interview that we have the application
18:33
that you applied with open on our screen
18:35
and we're looking at your application
18:36
while we're asking you questions or
18:38
taking notes all right this is how this
18:40
is how our workflow works on our side
18:42
now the first thing to understand is
18:44
that interviewers are trained to ask
18:46
basic questions help us understand your
18:49
startup these are not trick questions
18:51
these are basic simple questions and
18:54
these questions are highly context
18:56
dependent some folks over prepare for
19:00
interviews in a way that is not relevant
19:02
to them and they're surprised by the
19:04
questions we ask you you shouldn't be
19:06
surprised so for example if you are
19:08
pre-launch we often ask questions that
19:11
are relevant to a pre-launch company
19:12
when are you going to launch things like
19:15
that if you are in a regulated space say
19:17
fintech or insurance or things like that
19:19
we're going to ask you questions related
19:21
to your regulatory strategy if you're in
19:23
a space where there's many competitors
19:25
we're going to ask you about your
19:26
differentiation these are all very basic
19:28
questions and so I'd encourage you to
19:30
walk into the interview with an open
19:32
mind and expect to begin the interview
19:34
answering these basic questions and
19:37
hopefully this will turn into a quick
19:39
conversation about different topics once
19:41
we understand the basics for our initial
19:43
questions probably the biggest mistake I
19:45
see in folks preparing for their YC
19:48
interview is to treat it like an
19:49
adversarial process they treat it like I
19:52
don't know applying to college or I
19:55
don't I don't know how to explain it but
19:56
they you know we're we're like the other
19:58
team and their job is to like work
20:00
against us and there's a lot of YC
20:03
interview devices out there that I think
20:05
is pretty bad because it treats us as an
20:07
adversarial process and like let me make
20:09
something super clear to you the people
20:11
on our side of the zoom call when you
20:13
interview are likely the people that are
20:15
going to be working with your company if
20:18
you're accepted if you act
20:20
weird to them or mean to them or
20:22
adversarial to them that is completely
20:25
going to backfire on you because these
20:27
are the folks you're going to be working
20:28
with and the fact is interview is ask
20:30
themselves this question do I believe I
20:33
can have a productive productive working
20:35
relationship with these Founders okay so
20:37
to give you some examples Founders that
20:39
recite memorize speeches where they have
20:42
some memorized paragraph they just shout
20:43
at us oh man do we not like that uh
20:46
Founders that don't listen to the
20:47
question were asked and they did all
20:49
this preparation so they think they know
20:51
what we're going to ask and they recite
20:52
back some thing man do we not like that
20:55
and then finally Founders that seem to
20:56
be stretching the truth right like if we
20:58
ask very simple questions and we get the
21:00
sense that you're trying to fool us or
21:02
lie to us that's going to get you low
21:05
scores right because we're the people
21:06
you're going to be working with and um
21:08
if you don't seem trustworthy that
21:11
factors in okay so when you're preparing
21:13
for this remember this stuff in terms of
21:15
preparing for the interview most of the
21:17
folks that get into YC uh read the
21:20
instructions provide a lot of
21:21
instructions we also have official
21:23
videos like this particular video is an
21:25
official video put up by YC some folks
21:27
do extra interview practice uh with
21:30
other folks which can be helpful if it
21:33
helps you build confidence so that in
21:35
the moment you're not super nervous but
21:37
I just want to know it can backfire if
21:39
you train yourself if you do too much
21:41
preparation and you just give us
21:44
nonsense robotic answers so if you've
21:46
done so much interview preparation that
21:48
every time we ask a question you
21:50
immediately spout off some memorized
21:52
answer that will frustrate us and again
21:54
watch out for being coached by people
21:58
to be intentionally confusing or
22:00
misleading about what your company does
22:02
what the market is what your revenue is
22:04
we've heard a lot of horror stories out
22:06
there of someone being coached in an
22:09
interview preparation
22:11
basically try to fool us and that's not
22:15
helpful be thoughtful about what you say
22:17
and don't take anyone's advice too
22:19
seriously especially if it's not advice
22:21
that we're putting out ourselves okay so
What Makes a Successful Interview at YC?
22:23
let's talk about a successful interview
22:24
someone that gets into YC a good
22:26
interview is one where all the basic
22:28
questions that we ask are answered well
22:31
in a good interview the founders can
22:33
demonstrate a Mastery of their own
22:34
business they understand their own
22:36
numbers they understand the risks they
22:38
have a crisp idea on what to work on
22:40
next they have a really fleshed out view
22:42
of the whole business in our opinion the
22:44
founders are credible they're honest
22:47
they're self-aware about what the real
22:49
challenges are right like they're not in
22:51
denial about this but they still are
22:53
confident when they are speaking about
22:54
their business and then finally we
22:56
successful interviewees are
22:58
know how to be themselves and I know
23:00
this is like annoying when people like
23:01
Oh Be Yourself what does that mean let
23:03
me explain what I mean by be yourself it
23:05
means we want you to show up in an
23:06
authentic way
23:08
and not act like you're on a Shark Tank
23:11
Episode or a pitch competition there's
23:13
few things more Awkward for us on the
23:15
other side of the table when we you know
23:17
we get on a call and we want to talk to
23:18
you and you're like hello people we are
23:20
here to tell you about Urban oh man that
23:23
really
23:24
is rough on us the interviewers and so
23:27
try to just be natural and try to have a
23:29
good conversation and remember we're
23:30
people that want to see you succeed or
23:32
people that are looking for folks who
23:33
are excited to work with try to show who
23:36
your real self is for us to get excited
23:37
about working with if someone interviews
Post Interview Feedback
23:39
YC and they are not selected we send you
23:41
an email it has some quick feedback we
23:43
do our best to make it actionable and uh
23:46
focused on the most important factors in
23:48
our decision internalizing this feedback
23:50
and demonstrating that you've addressed
23:52
it in a future application is heavily
23:55
weighted in your favor you see what I'm
23:57
saying for folks that apply and don't
23:58
get in and then they address the
23:59
feedback from the interviewers the next
24:01
time they apply wow does that help we
24:03
really keep track of this stuff I
24:04
promise we do and for folks that really
24:06
internalize it and address the feedback
24:08
that helps in closing
24:11
um applying to Y combinator is simple
24:13
it's well documented it's a pretty good
24:16
bet in that
24:17
applying to IC is a tiny time commitment
24:20
with uncapped upside that could change
24:22
everything for you and your startup so
24:25
it's high Roi and then I just want to
24:27
encourage everyone out there to nurture
24:29
this mentality of creating luck which
24:31
means putting yourself out there over
24:33
and over and over again bring this to
24:35
all aspects of your startups because
24:37
it's a great lesson that's it thanks so
