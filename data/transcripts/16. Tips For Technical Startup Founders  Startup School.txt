Tips For Technical Startup Founders  Startup School

YC Group Partner Diana Hu was the CTO of her YC startup Escher Reality, which was acquired by Niantic (makers of Pokemon Go). She shares her advice for being a technical founder at the earliest stages - including topics like how to ship an MVP fast, how to deal with technology choices and technical debt, and how and when to hire an engineering team.

welcome everyone to how to build and
How to Build and Perpetuate as a Technical Founder
0:12
succeed as a technical founder for the
0:15
startup School talk quick intro I'm
0:17
Diana who I'm currently a group partner
0:20
at YC and previously I was a co-founder
0:24
and CTO for Azure reality which was a
0:27
startup building augmented reality SDK
0:30
for game developers and we eventually
0:33
had an exit and sold to Niantic where I
0:37
was the director of engineering and
0:38
heading up all of the AR platform there
0:41
so I know a few things about building
0:43
something from was just an idea to then
0:47
a prototype to launching an MVP which is
0:50
like a bit duct tapey to then scaling it
0:52
and getting to product Market fit and
0:55
scaling systems to millions of users so
0:58
what are we going to cover in this talk
1:00
is three stages first is what is the
1:05
role of the technical founder and who
1:07
are they number two how do you build in
1:11
each of the different stages where all
1:13
of you are in startup school ideating
1:16
which is just an idea you're just
1:17
getting started building an MVP once you
1:20
got some validation and getting it to
1:22
launch and then launch where you want to
1:24
iterate towards product Market fit
1:26
and then I'll have a small section on
1:29
how the role of the technical founder
1:31
evolved Pro product Market fit I won't
1:33
cover it too much because a lot of you
1:35
in startup School are mostly in this
1:38
earlier stage and I'm excited to give
1:40
this talk because I compiled it from
1:43
many conversations and chats with many
1:45
YC technical Founders like from algolia
1:50
segment optimal easily way up so I'm
1:53
excited for all of their inputs and
1:55
examples in here all right the technical
What Does a Technical Founder Do?
1:58
founder sometimes I hear non-technical
2:01
Founders say I need somebody to build my
2:04
app so that isn't going to cut it a
2:08
technical founder is a partner in this
2:11
whole journey of a startup and it
2:14
requires really intense level of
2:16
commitment and you're in just a Dev what
2:18
does a technical founder do they lead a
2:22
lot of the
2:23
building of the product of course
2:26
and also talking with users and
2:29
sometimes I get the question of who is
2:32
the CEO or CTO for a technical founder
2:34
and this is a nuanced answer it really
2:37
depends on the type of product the
2:39
industry you're in the complete scale
2:41
composition of the team to figure out
2:44
who the CEO of CTO is and I've seen
2:47
technical Founders be the CEO the CTO or
2:50
various other roles and what does the
2:52
role of the technical founder look like
2:54
in the early eight stages it looks a lot
2:57
like being a lead developer like if
3:00
you've been a lead developer a company
3:01
you were in charge of putting the
3:03
project together and building it and
3:05
getting it out to the finish line or if
3:07
you're contributing to an open source
3:08
project and you're the main developer
3:10
you make all the tech choices but
3:12
there's some key differences from being
3:15
a lead developer you got to do all the
3:18
tech things like if you're doing
3:20
software you're gonna have to do the
3:22
front and the back end devops the
3:25
website the ux even I.T to provision the
3:29
Google accounts anything if you're
3:32
building hardware and maybe you're just
3:34
familiar familiar with electrical and
3:35
working with eaglecad you'll have to get
3:37
familiar with the mechanical too and
3:40
you'll of course as part of doing all
3:42
the tech things you'll have to talk with
3:43
users to really get those insights to
3:46
iterate and you're going to have a bias
3:48
towards building a good enough versus
3:51
the perfect architecture because if you
3:54
worked at a big company
3:56
you might have been rewarded for the
3:58
perfect architecture but not for a
4:00
startup you're going to have bias
4:02
towards action and moving quickly and
4:04
actually deciding with a lot of
4:06
incomplete information you're gonna get
4:08
comfortable with technical debt
4:10
inefficient processes and a lot of ugly
4:13
code and basically lots of chaos and all
4:17
of these is to say is the technical
4:20
founder is committed to the success of
4:23
your company
4:24
and that means doing whatever it takes
4:26
to get it to work and it's not going to
4:29
cut it if you're an employee at a
4:30
company I sometimes hear oh this task or
4:33
this thing is not in my pay grade no
4:35
that's not going to cut it here you got
4:37
to do you gotta do it this next session
How To Build
4:39
on how to build the first stage is the
4:43
ideating stage where you just have an
4:46
idea of what you want to build and the
4:48
goal here is to build a prototype as
4:52
soon as possible with the singular Focus
4:55
to build something to show and demo to
4:58
users and it doesn't even have to work
5:01
fully in parallel your CEO co-founder
5:05
will be finding a list of users in these
5:08
next couple days to TF meetings to show
5:10
the Prototype when it's ready so the
5:12
principle here is to build very quickly
5:14
in a matter of days and sometimes I hear
5:17
it's like oh Diana a day prototype that
5:20
seems impossible how do you do it and
5:23
one way of doing it is building on top
5:25
of a lot of prototyping software and you
5:28
keep it super super simple so for
5:30
example if you're a software company you
5:33
will build a clickable prototype perhap
5:35
using something like figma or Envision
5:38
if you're a devtools company you may
5:40
just have a script that you wrote in an
5:42
afternoon and just launch it on the
5:44
terminal
5:45
if you're a hardware company or heart
5:47
attack it is possible to build a
5:49
prototype maybe it takes you a little
5:50
bit longer but the key here is 3D
5:52
renderings to really show you the
5:54
promise of what the product is and the
5:56
example I have here is a company called
5:58
Remora that is helping trucks capture
6:02
carbon with this attachment and that
6:05
example of that rendering was enough to
6:08
get the users excited about their
6:11
product even though it's hard tech so
6:13
give you a couple examples of prototypes
6:15
in the early days this company
6:16
optimizely went through YC on winter 10
6:19
and they put this prototype literally in
6:22
a couple of days and the reason why is
6:24
that they had applied with YC with a
6:26
very different idea they started with a
6:28
Twitter referral widget and that idea
6:30
didn't work and they quickly found out
6:32
why
6:33
so they strapped together very quickly
6:35
this prototype and it was because the
6:37
founders uh Pete and Dan and Dan was
6:40
actually heading analytics for the Obama
6:42
campaign and he recalled that he was
6:44
called to optimize one of the funding
6:47
pages and thought huh this could be a
6:49
startup so they put a very together very
6:51
quickly together and it was the first
6:53
visual editor by creating a a b test
6:55
that was just a Javascript file that
6:58
lived on S3 I literally just opened
7:00
option command J if you're in Chrome and
7:03
they literally run manually the A B test
7:05
there and it would work of course nobody
7:07
could use it except the founders but it
7:09
was enough to show it to marketers who
7:11
were the target users to optimize sites
7:13
to get the user excited so this was
7:16
built in just few days other example is
7:20
my startup Azure reality since we're
7:22
building more harder Tech we had to get
7:25
computer vision algorithms running on
7:27
phones and we got that done in a few
7:29
weeks that was a lot easier to show a
7:32
demo of what AR is as you saw on the
7:34
video than just explaining and hand
7:37
waving and made selling and explaining
7:39
so much easier now what are some common
7:42
mistakes on prototypes you don't want to
7:45
overbuild at this stage I've seen people
7:48
have this bias and they tell me hey
7:50
Diana but users don't see it or it's not
7:54
good enough this prototype doesn't show
7:55
the whole Vision this is the mistake
7:57
when founder things you need a full MVP
7:59
and the stage and not really the other
8:02
mistake is obviously not talking or
8:05
listening to users soon enough that
8:07
you're gonna get uncomfortable and show
8:08
this kind of prototyping duct type thing
8:11
that you just slap together and that's
8:14
okay you're gonna get feedback the other
8:16
one at the stage as an example for
8:18
optimizely when founders get too
8:21
attached to idea I went up the feedback
8:23
from users is something obvious that is
8:25
not quite there not something that users
8:27
want and it's not letting go of bad
Build an MVP: The Startup Process
8:30
ideas okay so now into the next section
8:33
so imagine you have this prototype you
8:36
talk to people and there's enough
8:38
interest then you move on to the next
8:39
stage of actually building an MVP that
8:42
works to get it to launch and the goal
8:44
is basically build it to launch and it
8:47
should be done also very quickly ideally
8:49
in a matter of can be done a few days
8:51
two weeks or sometimes months but
8:54
ideally more on the weeks range for most
8:56
software companies again exceptions to
8:58
hardware and deep tech companies so the
9:00
goal here at this stage is to build
9:03
something that you will get commitment
9:06
from users to use your product and
9:08
ideally what that commitment looks like
9:10
is getting them to pay and the reason
9:12
why you have a prototype is while you're
9:14
building this your co-founder or CEO
9:17
could be talking to users and showing
9:19
the Prototype and even getting
9:20
commitments to use it once is ready to
9:23
launch so I'm gonna do a bit of a bit of
9:25
a diversion here because sometimes
9:28
Founders get excited it's like oh I show
9:29
this prototype people are excited and
9:31
there's so much to build is hiring a
9:34
good idea
9:35
first is thing is like okay I got this
9:37
prototype got people excited I'm gonna
9:39
hire people to help me to build it as a
9:41
first-time founder he's like oh my God
9:42
oh my God there's a fit people want it
9:43
is it a good idea it really depends it's
9:46
gonna actually slow you down in terms of
9:49
launching quickly
9:50
because if you're hiring from a pool of
9:53
people and Engineers that you don't know
9:54
it takes over a month or more to find
9:57
someone good and it's hard to find
9:59
people at this stage with very nebulous
10:01
and chaotic so it's going to make you
10:02
move slowly and the other more Insidious
10:05
thing is going to make you
10:08
not develop some of the insights about
10:10
your product because your product will
10:12
evolved if someone else in your team is
10:14
building that and not the founders
10:15
you're gonna miss that key learning
10:17
about your tag that could have a gold
10:19
nugget but it was not built by you I
10:21
mean there's exceptions to this I think
10:23
you can hire a bit later when you have
10:26
things more built out but at this stage
10:28
it's still difficult so I'll give you a
10:31
example here uh Justin TV and twitch it
10:34
was just the four Founders and three
10:36
very good technical Founders at the
10:39
beginning for the MVP it was just the
10:42
founders building software as software
10:45
engineers and the magic was Justin
10:47
Emmett and Kyle Building different parts
10:50
of the system you had Kyle who become an
10:52
awesome Fearless engineer tackling the
10:54
hard problems of video streaming and
10:57
then Emma doing all the database work
10:59
Justin with the web and that was enough
11:00
to get it to launch I mean I'll give you
11:03
an exception after they launched they
11:05
did hire good Engineers but the key
11:07
thing about this they were very good at
11:10
not caring about the resume they try to
11:12
really find The Misfits and engineers at
11:15
Google overlooked and those turned out
11:16
to be amazing so Amon and Golem were
11:20
very comfortable and awesome engineers
11:22
and they took on a lot of the video
11:24
weapon just three months since joining
11:25
you want people like that that can just
11:27
take off and run all right so now
Principles for Building Your MVP
11:30
going back into the principles for for
11:33
building towards your MVP principle one
11:35
is the classic hologram essay on do
11:39
things that don't scale
11:41
basically find clever hacks to launch
11:43
quickly in the spirit of doing things at
11:46
those scale and the Drake posting
11:49
edition of this avoid things like
11:51
automatic self onboarding because that
11:53
adds a lot of engineering building a
11:55
scalable back-end automated scripts
11:57
those sounds great at some point but not
11:59
the stage and the hack perhaps could be
12:01
manually onboarding you're literally
12:03
editing the database and adding the
12:05
users or the entries and the data on the
12:07
other counterter thing is insane custom
12:10
support it's just you the founders at
12:12
the front line doing the work doing
12:14
things that don't scale a classic sample
12:16
is with stripe this is the site when
12:17
they launch very simple they had the API
12:19
for developers to send payments but on
12:22
the back end the thing that did not
12:24
scale it was literally the founders
12:26
processing every manual request and
12:29
filling Bank forms to process the
12:31
payments at the beginning and that was
12:33
good enough to get them to launch sooner
12:34
now principle number two this is famous
12:37
create 9010 solution that was coined by
12:41
Paul bukite who was one of the group
12:44
Partners here at YC and original
12:45
inventor of Gmail the first version is
12:48
not going to be the final remember and
12:49
they will very likely a lot of the code
12:51
be Rewritten and that's okay push off as
12:54
many features to post launch and by
12:57
launching quickly I created a 9010
12:58
solution I don't mean creating bugs I
13:01
still want it good enough but you want
13:03
to restrict the product to work on
13:06
limited Dimensions which could be like
13:08
situations type of data you handle
13:10
functionality type of users you support
13:13
could be the type of data the type
13:15
number of devices or it could be Geo
13:17
find a way to slice the problem to
13:19
simplify it and this can be your secret
13:21
superpowers that startup at the
13:22
beginning because you can move a Lot
13:24
quickly and large companies can't afford
13:26
to do this or even if your startup gets
13:28
big you have like lawyers and finance
13:31
teams and sales team that make you kind
13:34
of just move slow so give you a couple
13:36
examples here doordash at the beginning
13:38
they slapped it in one afternoon soon
13:41
and they were actually called Palo Alto
13:45
delivery and they took PDS for menus and
13:48
literally put their phone number that
13:50
phone number there is actually from one
13:52
of the founders and there's the site is
13:54
not Dynamic static it's literally just
13:57
plain HTML and CSS and PDF that was our
14:00
front end they didn't bother with
14:02
building a back end the back end quote
14:03
unquote was literally just Google forms
14:06
and Google Docs where they coordinated
14:07
all the orders and they didn't even
14:10
build anything to track all the drivers
14:12
or ETA they did that with using fancy on
14:16
your iPhone find my friends to track
14:18
where each of the deliveries were that
14:20
was enough so this was put together
14:21
literally in one afternoon and they were
14:24
able to launch the very genius thing
14:26
they did is that because they were
14:27
Stanford student they constrained it to
14:29
work only on Palo Alto and
14:31
counterintuitively by focusing on Palo
14:33
Alto and getting that right as they grew
14:35
it got them to focus and get delivery
14:38
and unit economics right in the suburbs
14:41
right at the beginning so that they
14:43
could scale that and get that right
14:45
versus the competition which was
14:47
focusing on Metro cities like GrubHub
14:49
which make them now you saw how the
14:52
story played out the unit economics and
14:54
the Ops was much harder and didn't get
14:56
it right so funny thing about focusing
14:58
at the beginning and getting those right
15:00
can get you to focus and do things right
15:02
that later on can serve you well so now
Choose the Tech Stack That Makes Sense for Your Startup
15:04
at this stage how do you choose a tech
15:08
stack so what one thing is to balance
15:10
what makes sense for your product and
15:12
your personal expertise to ship as
15:15
quickly as you can keep it simple don't
15:18
just choose a cool new programming
15:20
language just to learn it for your
15:21
startup choose what you're dangerous
15:23
enough and comfortable to launch quickly
15:25
which brings me to the next principle
15:28
choose the tag for iteration speed I
15:31
mean now and the other thing is also
15:34
it's very easy to build MVPs very
15:37
quickly by using third-party Frameworks
15:39
on API tools and you don't need to do a
15:42
lot of those work for example
15:43
authentication you have things like auth
15:45
zero payments you have stripe
15:46
cross-platform support and rendering you
15:48
have things like react native Cloud
15:50
infrastructure you have AWS gcp landing
15:53
pages you have webflow back-end back-end
15:56
serverless you have lambdas or Firebase
15:59
or hosted database in the past startups
16:03
would run out of money before even
16:04
launching because they had to build
16:06
everything from scratch and shift from
16:08
metal don't try to be the kind of like
16:10
cool engineer just build things from
16:12
scratch no just use all these Frameworks
16:14
but I know ctOS tell me oh it's too
16:16
expensive to use this third-party apis
16:19
or it's too slow it doesn't skill to use
16:22
XYZ so what I'm going to say to this I
16:25
mean there's there's two sides of the
16:27
story with using third party
16:29
I mean to move quickly but it doesn't
16:31
mean this this is a great meme that Sean
16:35
Wang who's the head of developer
16:38
experience that everybody posted the
16:40
funny thing about it is you have at the
16:42
beginning quartile kind of the noob that
16:45
just learned PHP or just JavaScript and
16:48
just kind of use it to build the toy car
16:50
serious engineers make fun of the new
16:52
because oh PHP language doesn't scale or
16:55
JavaScript and all these things it's
16:57
like oh our PHP is not a good language
16:59
blah blah and then the middle or average
17:02
or mid-wit Engineers like okay I'm gonna
17:04
put my big engineer pants and do what
17:07
Google would do and build something
17:09
optimal and scalable and use something
17:11
for the back end like Kafka Linker Ros
17:13
AMA Prometheus kubernetes Envoy big red
17:17
or hundreds of microservices okay that's
17:20
the average technical founder the
17:22
average startup dies so that's not a
17:23
good outcome another funny thing you got
17:25
the Jedi Master and when you squint
17:28
their Solutions look the same like the
17:30
new one they chose also PHP and
17:33
JavaScript but they choose it for
17:35
different reasons not because they just
17:36
learned it but they wreck recognizes
17:39
this is because they can move a lot
17:41
quicker and what I'm going to emphasize
17:43
here is that if you build a company and
17:46
it works and you get users good enough
17:48
the tech choices don't matter as much
17:50
you can solve your way out of it like
17:52
Facebook famously was built on PHP
17:55
because Mark was very familiar with that
17:57
and of course PHP doesn't quite scale or
17:59
is very performant but if you're
18:02
Facebook and you get to that scale of
18:04
the number of users they got you can
18:05
solve your way out and that's when they
18:08
built a custom transpiler called hip hop
18:11
to make PHP compound C plus plus so that
18:14
it would optimize see so that was the
18:16
Jedi move and even for JavaScript
18:18
there's a V8 engine which makes it
18:21
pretty performant so I think it's fine
18:22
way up was a 2015 company at YC that
18:27
helps company hire diverse companies and
18:29
is a job board for college students so
18:32
JJ the CTO although he didn't formally
18:35
study computer science or engineering at
18:37
UPenn he that taught himself how to
18:39
program on freelance for a couple years
18:42
before he started way up and JJ chose
18:45
again as the Jedi Master chose
18:47
technology for iteration speed he chose
18:50
Django and python although a lot of
18:52
other peers were telling him to go and
18:55
use Ruby and rails and I think in 2015
18:58
Ruby and rails were 10 times more
19:01
popular by Google Trends and that was
19:03
fine that that didn't kill the company
19:05
at all I mean that was the right choice
19:06
for them because he could move and get
19:08
this move quickly and get this out of
19:10
the door very quickly I kept it simple
19:12
in the back end postgres python
19:14
Heroku and that worked out well for them
19:17
now I'm going to summarize here the only
19:20
Tech choices that matter are the ones
19:23
tied to your customer promises for
19:25
example at Azure we in fact rewrote and
19:28
threw away a lot of the code multiple
19:30
times as we scale in different stages of
19:32
our Tech but the promise that we
19:34
maintain to our customers was at the API
19:36
level in unity and game engines and
19:39
that's the thing that we cannot throw
19:40
away but everything else we rewrote and
19:42
that's fine all right now we're gonna go
What Happens In The Launch Stage?
19:44
part three so you have the MVP you built
19:48
it and launched it now you launched it
19:50
so what happens on this stage your goal
19:53
here in the launch stage is to iterate
19:56
to get towards product Market fit so
19:59
principle number one is to quickly
20:02
iterate with hard and soft data use hard
20:06
data as a tech founder to make sure you
20:09
have set up a dashboard with analytics
20:10
that tracks your main kpi and again here
20:13
choose technology for your analytics
20:15
stack for Speed keep some keep it super
20:18
simple something like Google analytics
20:19
amplitude mix panel and don't go
20:22
overboard with something super complex
20:24
like lock stash Prometheus these are
20:27
great for large companies but not at
20:28
your stage you don't have that load
20:30
again use Soft Data if I keep talking to
20:33
users after you launch and marry these
20:36
two to know why users stay or churn
20:39
and ask to figure out what new problems
20:41
your users have to iterate and build we
20:44
pay another YC company when they launch
20:46
they were at b2c payments product kind
20:49
of a little bit like venmo-ish but the
20:51
thing is that it never really took off
20:53
they iterated so in terms of analytics
20:56
they saw some of the features that we're
20:58
launching like messaging nobody cared
21:00
nobody used and they found out in terms
21:03
of a lot of the payments their biggest
21:04
user was GoFundMe back then they also
21:07
talked to users they talk to GoFundMe
21:08
who didn't care for any of this b2c UI
21:12
stuff they just care to get the payments
21:15
and then they discover a better
21:17
opportunity to be an API and basically
21:19
pivoted it into it and they got the
21:22
first version and again applying the
21:24
principles that did a scale they didn't
21:26
even have technical docs and they worked
21:28
with GoFundMe to get this version and
21:31
this API version was the one that
21:33
actually took off and got them to
21:34
product Market fit principle number two
21:36
in this launch stage is to continuously
21:39
launch perfect example of this is a
21:41
segment who started as a very different
21:42
product they were classroom analytics
21:45
similar stories they struggled with this
21:48
first idea it didn't really work out
21:49
until they launched a stripped out
21:52
version of just their back end which was
21:53
actually segment and see the impressive
21:56
number of launches they did their very
21:59
first launch was back in December
22:02
2012. that was their very first post and
22:05
you saw the engagement in Hacker News
22:07
very high that was a bit of a hint of a
22:09
product Market fit and they got excited
22:11
and they pivoted into this and kept
22:13
launching every week they had a total of
22:15
five launches in a span of a month or so
22:19
and they kept adding features and
22:20
iterating they added support for more
22:23
things when they launched it only
22:24
supported Google analytics mixpanel and
22:26
intercom and by listening to the users
22:28
they added node PHP support and
22:31
WordPress and it kept on going
22:34
and it took them to be then a unicorn
22:37
that eventually had an exit to Twilight
22:39
for over three billion dollars pretty
22:42
impressive too now
When You Launch: The Right Way to Build Tech
22:44
the last principle here what I want to
22:46
say for when you're launch there's this
22:48
funny state where you have Tech builds
22:50
you want to balance building versus
22:52
fixing you want to make thoughtful
22:54
choices between fixing bugs or adding
22:57
new features or addressing technical
22:58
debt and one I want to say Tech debt is
23:01
totally fine you gotta get comfortable a
23:03
little bit with the heat of your Tech
23:05
burning totally okay you're gonna fear
23:07
the right things and that is towards
23:09
getting you product Market fit sometimes
23:11
that tiny bug and rendering maybe is not
23:14
critical for you at this point to fix
23:16
like in fact a lot of early products are
23:19
very broken you're probably very
23:21
familiar with Pokemon go when it
23:23
launched in 2016 nobody could log into
23:26
the game and guess what that did not
23:28
kill the company at all in fact to this
23:31
day Pokemon I think last year made over
23:34
a billion dollars in Revenue that did
23:36
not kill them and I'll give a little
23:38
background what was happening on the
23:39
tech it was very uh very straightforward
23:42
they had a load balancer that was on
23:44
Google cloud and they had a back-end and
23:47
they had a TCP termination and HTTP
23:49
requests that were done with their nginx
23:52
to route to the different servers that
23:54
were the AFE the application front end
23:56
to manage all the requests and the issue
23:59
with there it was that as users were
24:02
connected they didn't get terminated
24:04
until they got to the nginx
24:06
and then as a result client also had
24:09
retries and that what happened when you
24:12
had such a huge load that in fact I
24:14
think Pokemon go by the first month
24:17
after launching they had the same number
24:19
of uh active as as Twitter which took
24:22
them 10 years to get there and they got
24:23
there in one month of course things
24:25
would break it was basically a lot of
24:26
users trying to log in was kind of
24:28
creating a bit of a dito's attack now
24:30
December is a bit on when you launch
24:32
some of the common mistakes after
24:34
launching and I myself has made CTO Doge
24:38
sad it is tempting to to build and say
24:41
what would Google do that's almost
24:43
certainly a trap would try to build like
24:47
a big company or hiring to try to move
24:51
quickly sometimes I think this is more
24:53
of a nuanced question can be a mistake
24:55
or the other thing is focusing too much
24:57
on fixing refactoring and not building
24:59
features towards iterating to product
25:01
Market fit not discovering insights from
25:03
users sometimes I see ctOS like okay we
25:06
launched I get to conquer down and just
25:08
get into building totally no again your
25:10
role as a technical founder very
25:12
different you got to be involved in the
25:14
journey and really understand the
25:15
insights of why users Stay or Leave Your
25:18
products you have to keep talking to
25:19
them and the other mistake I see is like
25:21
oh we're just building features for
25:22
their product
25:23
but you also need to build Tech to grow
25:27
in fact some of the best growth hacks
25:30
where Engineers pair it up with sales
25:34
and growth folks who are non-technical
25:35
so now the last section on how the role
How the role evolved from ideating to hiring
25:38
evolves so assuming you got product
25:40
Market fit what happens this is this
25:43
point where you can actually then put on
25:46
your big engineering pants
25:48
and figure out pieces of the tech that
25:52
need to be built to scale you need to
25:55
and the attack will break which is
25:57
actually a good thing breaking because
25:58
of too much demand and that's totally
26:00
okay that's my example from Pokemon go
26:03
you'll find the pieces that need to be
26:05
reworked refactor this is when you do it
26:07
not before now not before product Market
26:09
fit and you'll decide also what the
26:12
engineering culture will look like and
26:14
this is a stage where you actually do
26:15
more of the hiring and here you're
26:17
probably going to evolve from leading a
26:20
small team of Engineers to hiring your
26:22
first hires who are going to be people
26:23
that you know and at this point Your
26:25
Role really changes because you'll start
26:27
having communication overhead and this
26:30
is when you realize your role morphs
26:32
like between two to five you still get
26:34
time to code about 70 when you get to
26:36
five to ten you only have less than 50
26:38
percent and Beyond 10 you probably won't
26:41
really have time to code and have to
26:43
decide how to structure things and
26:45
whether you're going to remain as a
26:47
architect type or role or you want to be
26:49
more of a people role and be more of a
26:50
BP rich now to summarize uh hear the
Summary
26:53
talk first stage ideating Bill the goal
26:57
is to build a prototype as soon as
26:59
possible and the principle is built very
27:02
quickly in a matter of days stage two
27:04
you're in the process of building an MVP
27:07
which I think a lot of you are in this
27:09
or the previous one the goal is to build
27:11
as quickly to launch in a matter of few
27:14
weeks
27:15
and the principles are do things that
27:16
don't scale create a 90 10 solution
27:18
choose the tech for iteration speed and
27:22
the last one is once you launch all of
27:25
the previous ideas on 9010 solution do
27:28
things that don't scale still apply and
27:30
add these onto it and the goal is to get
27:33
an iteration towards product Market fit
27:35
so you're going to also quickly iterate
27:37
with hard and soft data with analytics
27:39
and user interviews
27:41
you're going to continuously launch and
27:44
you're going to find the fine balance
27:46
between building and fixing and where
27:49
techdat is totally fine
27:51
feel the heat for that Tech that is
27:53
totally fine and if there's only one
27:55
take away from this whole talk is that
27:57
startups move quickly so thank you
