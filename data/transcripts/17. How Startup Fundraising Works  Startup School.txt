I'm Brad Flora I'm a group partner here
0:12
at YC and I'm going to be talking about
0:13
how startup fundraising works today like
0:16
I said I'm a group partner at YC and
0:18
what that means is that I read
0:20
applications I interview the startups
0:23
that apply and then I work with them to
0:25
try to make something people want and
Fundraising resources
0:27
one of the topics that people ask about
0:29
all the time at YC is fundraising in
0:32
fact it's probably the thing that we get
0:34
asked about more often than anything
0:36
else and the reason for that is because
0:38
as Paul Graham wrote years ago raising
0:41
money is the second hardest part of
0:43
starting a startup after making
0:44
something people want so let's take a
0:46
quick tour of all the awesome stuff that
0:48
YC's put out about fundraising over the
0:49
years first there's the Paul Graham
0:51
essays he wrote the fundraising Survival
0:53
Guide how to fund a startup how to
0:56
convince investors to invest in your
0:58
company and even wrote a great essay
1:00
about understanding investor herd
1:02
Dynamics all of the stuff's online you
1:04
can see the links below you should check
1:06
it out years later just a little bit ago
1:08
YC president Jeff Ralston posted a
1:11
terrific guide to raising a seed round
1:12
where he covers everything from start to
1:14
finish that you need to know the Nitty
1:16
Gritty on how to raise a seed round and
1:19
he gave a great video presentation at
1:21
startup School a few years ago where he
1:22
presented that material it's on YouTube
1:24
you should check it out it'll tell you
1:26
how to raise a seed round finally we've
1:28
posted a lot of tactical guides about
1:30
specific aspects of fundraising how to
1:33
build a seed deck how to pitch your
1:35
startup how to get meetings with
1:37
investors and how to raise money online
1:39
for startups using platforms like Angel
1:41
list we've even got something about the
1:43
different types of investors and their
1:44
incentives so if you really want to get
1:46
specific and drill into stuff there's
1:48
content for you that you can find what I
1:50
didn't want to do today is just rehash
1:52
all of that stuff because it's already
1:53
out there what I wanted to do instead is
1:56
talk about some of the misconceptions
1:58
and myths that we see as YC Partners
2:01
when we work with Founders Founders out
2:04
there are consuming all sorts of
2:05
information in the media and a lot of it
2:07
is about startup fundraising and there's
2:10
some things in there that just are not
2:11
true that we're going to talk about the
7 fundraising myths
2:13
goal of this talk is to catch you up on
2:15
how fundraising actually works today and
2:17
we're going to do that by exploring
2:19
seven fundraising myths and for each one
2:21
of them we're going to talk about the
2:23
myth the reality behind the myth and
2:25
then look at some great YC companies
2:27
that bust that myth before we get
2:29
started just a little bit more about me
2:31
I'm a YC partner but I've also been on
2:33
both sides of the table as a founder and
2:35
an investor from 2008 to 2014 I was
2:38
building startups and the company that I
2:40
got the most success was perfect
2:42
audience which was an ad retargeting
2:45
startup for small businesses I took
2:47
perfect audience through the YC summer
2:48
11 batch 11 years ago and we raised a
2:52
million dollar seed round after demo day
2:54
I hired a bunch of great people we grew
2:57
to three million dollars in revenue and
2:58
we were acquired in 2014. after that
3:00
acquisition I got really into investing
3:03
in startups it started with Angel
3:05
Investing where I was writing just a few
3:07
checks five thousand dollars ten
3:09
thousand dollars into YC companies that
3:12
I thought sounded really cool at demo
3:13
day but I got hooked the thrill of going
3:16
and meeting Founders finding out what
3:18
their deal is trying to figure out are
3:19
they making something people want should
3:21
I invest was too much for me and
3:23
suddenly I was raising a fund with some
3:25
friends to scale up and invest in even
3:27
more YC companies and so through that
3:29
fund I invested in 150 YC companies and
3:32
the good news for my backers is that we
3:34
got into some great companies you may
3:36
have heard of a few of them deal open C
3:39
retool razor pay it was really awesome
3:41
to help those companies raise their
3:42
first round funding and it's been a lot
3:45
of fun being involved since eventually
3:47
though I joined YC as a group partner
3:49
and I get to do both sides I get act as
3:52
a Founder as a fellow peer to the YC
3:54
Founders and help them figure out how to
3:55
make something people want and then use
3:57
my investor experience to help them
3:59
figure out how to raise money so I've
4:01
got a good view of this I've been
4:02
involved in a lot of seed fundraising so
4:04
let's get started with these myths and
Raising money is glamorous
4:06
for the first one I want to talk about
4:07
is this idea that raising money is
4:11
glamorous what's the image in your head
4:13
that you think of when you think of
4:15
startup fundraising for a lot of you it
4:18
might be something like this this is an
4:20
image of Shark Tank and it's a
4:22
television show where entrepreneurs they
4:24
dress up they make a sign they get a
4:27
bunch of materials and they pitch a
4:29
bunch of investors at once called sharks
4:32
and these are a bunch of people of
4:34
varying levels of investor expertise who
4:36
hear the pitch ask a bunch of uh nosy
4:39
kind of pushy questions and then fire
4:41
offers that the founder rapid fire and
4:44
so if you watch this you may be thinking
4:45
gosh I've gotta put a whole presentation
4:48
together like this and I'm gonna pitch a
4:50
bunch of people and they're going to ask
4:51
me all these tough questions and it's
4:52
going to be this high pressure situation
4:54
nation that I've got to figure out the
4:56
reality is that fundraising actually
4:58
looks like this this is a picture taken
5:01
in the creamery which is a now departed
5:04
Cafe in San Francisco notice what's
5:06
happening here it's just a bunch of
5:08
people sitting in chairs talking quietly
5:11
amongst themselves right it's just a
5:13
bunch of coffee chats that's how
5:15
fundraising actually looks that's what
5:17
it actually feels like is just sitting
5:19
in a cafe talking to someone Shark Tank
5:21
the pitch competitions the business plan
5:23
competitions they're just for show
5:25
they're marketing events for the
5:27
organizations that put them on and in
5:29
fact a lot of the investors at these
5:31
things they don't invest they're just
5:33
there to meet other investors and hang
5:34
out and even on Shark Tank I think Mark
5:37
Cuban recently said that even though
5:38
he's put 20 million dollars into these
5:40
companies he hasn't made a dime yet he's
5:42
still in the red actual fundraising is
5:45
just a bunch of one-on-one meetings on
5:47
Zoom over and over again while you try
5:50
to collect checks and convince investors
5:52
It's a Grind okay what you see here is a
5:55
diagram that was made by an actual YC
5:57
company called fresh paint that shows
5:59
what an actual round of fundraising
6:01
looked like for their startup you see at
6:03
the top the company in each one of these
6:05
circles and squares represents a
6:07
different investor that they met with
6:08
and when the boxes are connected it's
6:10
because that investor made an
6:12
introduction for them they met with 160
6:14
investors and 39 of them said yes which
6:17
is a very high conversion rate but the
6:18
check range was all over the place they
6:20
had people write 5K checks and people
6:22
write 200k checks all right not
6:24
everybody with some fancy VC they could
6:26
write a giant check and it took them
6:28
four months and 18 days to get through
6:31
all these meetings and close all these
6:33
deals and that was to raise 1.6 million
6:36
dollars fundraising was painful and it
6:38
was a grind but it was pretty
6:39
straightforward it was just a bunch of
6:41
conversations they've written a great
6:43
blog post that's where this image comes
6:45
from that you can check out should
6:46
definitely read it so great example of
6:49
what it's actually like to raise money
The need to raise money before starting a startup
6:51
okay the next myth I want to talk about
6:52
is this idea that I need to raise money
6:55
before I can start working on my startup
6:57
all right we see this a lot with
6:59
Founders we meet people that have a big
7:01
idea which is great and the next thought
7:04
they have is well gosh I guess I need to
7:06
raise money so I can build my big idea
7:08
but that's not how the best Founders
7:10
actually think about fundraising the
7:12
best Founders they build the first
7:14
version of the product first even if
7:16
it's a simple almost toy-like version of
7:20
it and then they go get some users for
7:22
it and then only then when they see that
7:24
people are starting to use it and maybe
7:26
there's some value being created do they
7:28
start thinking about raising money and
7:30
the reason for this is that it's cheaper
7:31
than ever to build a prototype of a
7:33
product to build a first version okay
7:35
it's cheaper than ever to host a website
7:37
and and build software it gets easier
7:39
and easier and easier every year and
7:42
also it's easier than ever to find
7:43
potential users you can get users on
7:46
platforms like product hunt on Hacker
7:48
News you can find users on social media
7:50
Twitter LinkedIn everybody's on the
7:53
internet today and you can use that to
7:55
find early people to try out your
7:57
product and when you do this when you've
7:59
got a little bit of product just a
8:00
little bit and a few users for it it
8:03
immediately gives you a great deal of
8:05
Leverage all right you've gone from that
8:08
person waving the pitch deck around
8:10
trying to figure out how to find 20
8:11
million dollars to someone whose startup
8:14
is in motion and investors want to jump
8:16
on trains that are in motion here's an
8:19
example solugen is a YC company from the
8:22
winter 17 batch and they are a chemical
8:24
manufacturing startup they literally
8:26
make chemicals and sell them as you can
8:29
imagine that is a capital intensive
8:31
business it requires a lot of money to
8:34
build a facility that can make chemicals
8:36
and sell them at scale and a certain
8:38
type of founder that had this idea would
8:41
then make a pitch deck and go around
8:43
telling investors I need 10 million
8:45
dollars I need 20 million dollars to
8:47
build the menu manufacturing plant to
8:49
make these chemicals the solution folks
8:51
chose a different path which is first
8:53
they built a tiny version of their
8:55
reactor that fit on a desk but it worked
8:57
next they built a slightly larger
9:00
version of that that could actually make
9:01
enough hydrogen peroxide to sell and
9:04
they took that to YC when they applied
9:06
for the winter 17 batch and during the
9:09
batch they started making enough
9:10
hydrogen peroxide using this slightly
9:12
larger version of the machine that they
9:15
could go and sell it to First customers
9:17
turned out that hot tub supply stores
9:21
needed hydrogen peroxide to sell the
9:24
people that add hot tubs and so they
9:26
were making ten thousand dollars a month
9:28
selling hydrogen peroxide to hot tub
9:30
supply stores not a ton of money but
9:32
let's step back for a second if you were
9:34
an investor and you were trying to
9:36
invest in a chemical Manufacturing
9:38
Company who would you back the person
9:40
with the pitch deck asking for 20
9:42
million dollars or the people that have
9:44
built a first version of this even if
9:46
it's small and making small amounts of
9:48
the product and selling it to hot tub
9:51
supply stores which is hardly a huge
9:53
business but it's something
9:55
well investors clearly want the second
9:57
Solid Gym is able to raise four million
9:59
dollars for to get started on their
10:01
company because they'd already made some
10:03
progress and today they've since raised
10:05
400 million dollars and they've scaled
10:08
this up to having a full manufacturing
My startup need to be impressive to raise money
10:10
plant let's talk about our next myth
10:12
this idea that my startup needs to be
10:14
impressive to raise money I've got to
10:16
impress people with my startup but my
10:19
startups startup is not very impressive
10:20
so how can I ever do this well the
10:23
reality is you don't need to impress
10:24
investors you need to convince them and
10:28
that's a slightly different thing see
10:29
most startups seem terrible at first and
10:32
in fact the best startups seem the most
10:34
terrible at first so let's take Airbnb
10:38
what was it it was a Marketplace for
10:40
renting an air mattress on someone's
10:42
floor
10:43
terrible idea doordash
10:45
food delivery for the suburbs where it
10:48
takes longer to get everywhere and no
10:50
one's ever started a delivery company
10:51
before
10:52
terrible idea open c a Marketplace for
10:56
selling Collectibles that only exist on
10:58
your computer and can only be paid for
11:01
with magical internet money what but
11:04
investors get this they know that your
11:07
startup is going to sound unimpressive
11:08
early on investors are pretty smart they
11:10
get it and in fact they get bored when
11:12
founders try to impress them okay really
11:15
try to win them over and sell to them it
11:16
bores them about 11 years ago and I did
11:18
YC I had a chance to have a five minute
11:21
meeting with Michael Moritz who at the
11:23
time and it was a partner at Sequoia
11:25
capital is legendary VC and I was so
11:28
excited for this meeting I made a fancy
11:31
deck I practiced all these lines I was
11:33
going to use on him to impress him and
11:35
conv and get him to invest in my startup
11:37
and I sat down with him and I opened my
11:39
laptop to get the slides out and he
11:42
stopped me and just said I prefer to
11:44
just talk about the business you're
11:45
building and I was completely disarmed
11:47
because I wasn't ready for that I was
11:49
ready to impress him not to try to just
11:52
talk about the business that I was
11:53
building and we see this similar
11:55
thinking with a lot of Founders at YC
11:57
where they come to us they don't
11:59
explicitly ask us this but they more or
12:00
less say Brad what are the magic words I
12:03
need to say to make investors want to
12:05
invest in my startup and the reality is
12:07
that it's not about magic words it's
12:09
about making something people want right
12:11
that YC Credo
12:13
it's about making a product getting it
12:16
into users hands and creating some value
12:18
for them and then just explaining how
12:21
there's a one percent chance even just a
12:23
one percent chance that it can get huge
12:25
and using plain simple language to do it
12:28
that's how you convince investors okay
12:30
if investors aren't investing it's not
12:33
because you didn't say the magic words
12:34
it's because your startup isn't good
12:36
enough and you need to make your startup
12:38
better and so have these conversate you
12:40
make your startup better and you just
12:41
explain it to people and talk about it
12:43
like a human and do it over and over and
12:45
over again because again startup
12:48
fundraising is a grind here's an example
12:49
of a company that did a great job
12:51
convincing investors when they met with
12:53
them this is retool and retool makes
12:55
software for building internal tools
12:57
it's a great company they raise their
12:59
seed round you see the founder David and
13:01
one of the CEO and co-founder by just
13:03
meeting a bunch of investors in coffee
13:04
shops in San Francisco I was lucky
13:07
enough to meet with David and he had no
13:08
DAC instead he just opened his laptop
13:11
and showed me the software on his
13:13
computer and he used that early kind of
13:15
crude version of retool to make a crude
13:18
but simple internal tool a little web
13:21
app in minutes
13:22
and then he talked about why his early
13:24
customers really liked it and we're
13:26
getting some value from it and just
13:28
seeing this seeing him show me the
13:29
product and talk about what his
13:31
customers were making of it put in my
13:34
head this idea that a lot of companies
13:35
probably are going to need this I was
13:37
convinced he didn't impress me he didn't
13:39
try to wow me he just showed me and
13:42
talked in a reasonable way about what he
13:43
was doing and that convinced me I wrote
13:45
a check and today that company is at a
13:47
four billion dollar valuation wasn't
13:49
about doing a fancy pitch but it wasn't
13:51
about magic words it was just about
13:53
making something and then talking about
13:55
it with me the next myth I want to talk
Raising money is complicated, slow, and expensive.
13:57
about is that raising money is
13:59
complicated slow and expensive if you
14:02
read a lot about fundraising in the
14:04
Press
14:04
you might think that it involves raising
14:08
giant rounds from big name VCS why is
14:11
that well let's take a look at
14:13
yesterday's TechCrunch headlines about
14:15
fundraising we've got a story about
14:17
Shopify Mark Vision locket Sprague what
14:20
do we see folks what's the common uh
14:22
denominator here gigantic numbers and so
14:26
you're reading this at home and you're
14:27
just trying to think how can I raise
14:29
twenty five thousand dollars to quit my
14:31
job or spend more time on this or get a
14:35
Hosting account for the website that I
14:36
want to build you're not thinking about
14:38
a hundred million dollars gosh maybe
14:40
this isn't for you well the reality is
14:42
is that all the rounds you read about in
14:43
the news are series A's and growth
14:45
rounds you don't read much about the
14:47
actual you don't read anything about the
14:48
actual first rounds of funding that
14:50
companies raise why because it's boring
14:52
okay it's really boring we already
14:55
established that there's no glamor in
14:57
the actual early fundraising that
14:58
startups do so it never makes the press
15:00
these typical A and B rounds are huge
15:02
right you raise 10 to 50 million dollars
15:04
they take months to close and you pay
15:07
hundreds of thousands of dollars to
15:08
lawyers and legal fees to get these
15:10
rounds done the good news is like I said
15:12
that's not what a lot of these rounds
15:13
look like your typical seed round is
15:16
actually much smaller 500 000 maybe a
15:19
couple million dollars you can close it
15:20
in weeks if not days and there's no
15:23
legal fees and this is the same for if
15:25
you're trying to raise a precede or just
15:27
trying to raise fifty thousand dollars
15:28
from friends and family you can do that
15:30
quickly and there's no need to get
15:32
lawyers involved why is that well in
15:35
2013 YC created a new standard
15:38
fundraising document
15:40
called the safe the simple agreement for
15:43
Equity so initially this was made by YC
15:46
to be the new standard document that all
15:50
YC companies would use and it turned out
15:52
for fundraising and it turned out to be
15:54
so great that now every startup uses
15:56
this to raise their money the safes are
15:58
awesome first off it's easy to
16:00
understand it's only five pages long
16:03
uh it's really fast to close an
16:05
investment using a safe there's only a
16:07
couple terms to discuss the amount of
16:09
the investment the valuation cap of the
16:11
investment and then the discount and
16:13
guess what nobody does discounts so
16:15
there's only two terms that you really
16:17
need to discuss when closing a safe and
16:19
finally they're cheap you don't need
16:21
lawyers to send them also the safe is
16:23
just on the YC website if you Google why
16:25
combinator safe you can find the
16:27
document download it to your computer
16:29
and use it this afternoon to close an
16:31
investment in your startup how cool is
16:33
that safes are so simple that there's
16:35
even a website called clerky it's a YC
16:37
company from my batch summer 11 that
16:39
lets you send and sign them in just a
16:41
few clicks safes give Founders
16:43
fundraising superpowers and you don't
16:46
have to wait months for investors to get
16:49
organized and for lawyers to review
16:51
stuff founders today just take all the
16:53
meetings they sign a bunch of safe and
16:55
they raise Millions for their startup in
16:57
just a few clicks and this quick and
16:59
cheap fundraising gives them more
17:01
leverage than ever
17:03
when they're talking to investors here's
17:05
an example you could build your company
17:06
like Azure bio so this is a biotech
17:09
startup from the summer 19 match that's
17:11
developing cancer therapies again
17:14
Capital intensive business and the
17:16
typical first rounds of funding are tens
17:18
of millions of dollars for companies
17:19
like this and so Founders go they make a
17:22
pitch deck and they've got to go get
17:23
this money before they can start working
17:25
on the on the startup the founders of
17:26
Astra came into YC with just the idea
17:28
and they were able to raise the first
17:31
round of funding using safes quickly
17:33
from Angels this is pretty novel for a
17:35
biotech company and using that first
17:37
million or so that they raised they
17:39
could accelerate their progress they
17:41
could make more progress in the lab and
17:43
when they were ready to start talking to
17:45
larger investors in the Pharma space
17:47
about a proper round they've made a lot
17:49
more progress and they had more leverage
17:51
in talking to those investors they've
17:53
since raised over 150 million dollars
17:55
but that first million that they raised
17:58
in safes totally changed the power
18:00
dynamics for them when talking to
18:01
investors the safety change the game for
I am going to lose control of my company
18:04
them related
18:06
myth is this idea and I hear this a lot
18:08
hey if I raise money I'm going to lose
18:10
control of my company
18:12
well the reality is that seed rounds
18:15
today give Founders more control than
18:18
ever okay Founders have had more can
18:21
have more control over their companies
18:22
today than ever in the history of
18:25
startups and why is this it's because
18:27
when you raise the safes you don't give
18:28
up any board seats all right there's
18:30
there's no board seat nonsense in safes
18:32
after you close the investment it's
18:34
still just you and your co-founders
18:35
calling the shots there's no
18:37
shareholders after you close money with
18:39
safes the investors on safes gets shares
18:42
in the next round okay so no Shares are
18:45
actually changing hands and there's no
18:47
information rights granted in safes so
18:49
there's nobody like requesting to look
18:51
into your books looking over your
18:52
shoulder you get to choose how and when
18:55
to update your investors when you raise
18:56
money with safes so again Founders
18:58
raising millions of dollars they're only
19:00
selling 10 to 20 percent of their
19:01
company and they're keeping total
19:03
control of the companies and when you do
19:06
that you can build the company the way
19:08
you want and Answer to No One except
19:11
your customers well pretty important but
19:13
instead of answering new investors you
19:14
answer to your customers when you raise
19:16
seed rounds today here's a great example
19:18
you could build your startup by zapier
19:20
they describe themselves as three dudes
19:21
from Missouri and zapier is software
19:24
that help you set up Integrations if
19:27
you've got one app that you use in
19:28
another app and you want them to talk to
19:29
each other you can use zapier to set
19:31
that up it's awesome they did the YC
19:33
summer 12 batch and they applied with an
19:35
early version of their software they had
19:37
a few customers and they raised over a
19:39
million dollars from angels and small
19:40
funds at demo day and because they did
19:42
that because they raised on safes and
19:45
they just raised a bunch of checks they
19:47
were able to run their company the way
19:48
they wanted and for them 10 years ago
19:50
that meant going fully remote 10 years
19:53
ago a decade before it was cool for
19:55
startups to do that it was pretty weird
19:56
at the time and they ran their company
19:58
the way they wanted to they spent the
20:00
next decade just delighting thousands
20:02
and thousands of customers and they also
20:04
made the decision to never raise money
20:06
again they never needed to so folks
20:08
thinking gosh if I raise money I'm
20:10
always going to be indebted to investors
20:11
yada yada no maybe later if you raise
20:14
these crazy priced rounds but for the
20:16
early money that you raised on safes you
20:19
have total control and you can be like
20:21
the zap your Founders and never raise
20:23
money again and today that's 100 million
20:26
dollar Revenue business and they only
20:28
raised money that one time now what
20:30
about bootstrapping you might be
20:31
thinking I should bootstrap my company
20:33
well everybody bootstraps it first
20:34
that's true but I want to tell you that
20:36
bootstrapping your company forever sucks
20:39
and here's why so first off when you
20:41
bootstrap forever and what I mean by
20:43
bootstrapping I mean
20:45
um funding the company out of the
20:46
revenue that you make from customers
20:48
it's scary all right you're always about
20:51
to shut down you're always about to run
20:52
out of money it's miserable because you
20:54
don't have any money to pay yourselves a
20:56
decent salary to live on it's
20:58
distracting you have to go into
20:59
Consulting in order to make the money
21:02
you need to keep working on your
21:03
products sometimes you have all these
21:05
detours when you're bootstrapping and
21:07
then finally the odds just aren't great
21:08
there are very few examples of 100
21:11
gigantic bootstrapped companies and I
21:14
think if it was the way to go there'd be
21:16
a lot more of those I actually want to
21:17
propose the definition of bootstrapping
21:19
so bootstrapping is taking the pain of
21:22
fundraising and stretching it out across
21:25
the entire life of your company why
21:27
would you want to do that I propose to
21:29
you that you should rip off the Band-Aid
21:31
and take the pain up front
21:34
and raise money for your company and
21:36
then you never have to raise money again
21:38
if you don't want to you can be like the
21:40
zap your Founders and besides at the end
21:42
of the day who's more in control of
21:44
their startup in the end is it the
21:46
bootstrapped founder who's always
21:48
worried about running out of money or
21:50
the founders that raise enough money to
21:52
get the company going after they've
21:53
built a product and gotten some users
21:55
and they can just make their customers
21:57
happy and they never have to raise again
I need a fancy network to raise money
21:58
the next myth I want to talk about is
22:00
this idea that I need a fancy Network to
22:02
raise money the reality is that if you
22:04
are making something people want
22:06
investors don't care about where you
22:08
went to school where you worked who
22:10
you're friends with how old you are even
22:12
investors are human and sure they notice
22:14
pedigree but guess what folks investors
22:17
are coin operated lizard people and they
22:21
care a lot more about making money you
22:24
can build your company like Podium
22:25
Podium is a company that started off
22:28
making customer review management
22:30
software for tire shops all right if
22:33
you're a tire shop and you're worried
22:35
about what people are saying about you
22:36
on Yelp you might use Podium to keep
22:38
track of that the co-founders were two
22:40
guys from Utah they had no Silicon
22:42
Valley Network however they were really
22:44
good at sales and they came into YC they
22:47
were already making money and by the end
22:49
of the batch they were making tens of
22:51
thousands of dollars a month I actually
22:52
randomly bumped into them at an alumni
22:55
event during their batch and I was
22:57
stunned that there was a company selling
22:58
software to tire shops in y combinator
23:01
and even more stunned when I found out
23:02
how much money they were making
23:03
investors noticed that too that they'd
23:05
made something people want and they were
23:07
able to raise and now today that company
23:09
makes a hundred million dollars a year
23:11
and has raised more than 200 million
23:13
dollars these folks had no network these
23:15
are not fancy Founders they just made
23:17
something people want slight tangent
23:18
while we're on this topic
23:20
you'll probably run into people if
23:22
you're thinking about fundraising who
23:24
are going to offer to raise money for
23:25
you
23:26
I have the network I know investors let
23:29
me go in there and Pitch your company it
23:30
is not a good idea it's always best for
23:33
the founders to talk to investors
23:34
themselves it's an important
23:36
relationship and you want to own it so
23:37
if someone makes you that offer you
23:39
should get them to make an introduction
23:40
instead and then you can go take the
23:42
meeting all right the last myth I'm
If investors reject my startup its a bad startup
23:44
going to talk about today is the myth
23:46
that if investors reject my startup that
23:48
means it's a bad startup the reality is
23:50
that no matter how great your product is
23:52
how much traction you have investors are
23:55
going to reject you and that's okay in
23:58
fact it puts you in great company right
24:00
here's a great example Envision so
24:02
Envision is a medical device startup for
24:04
cancer detection and it was started by
24:07
serbisarna who's a YC group partner
24:09
today when Serbia started building
24:10
Envision she had a devil of a Time
24:13
raising her first check she was rejected
24:16
more than 50 times by investors to just
24:18
get the first money for the company and
24:20
the way that she was able to convince
24:22
someone to write that first check and to
24:24
help her get this company started was
24:26
she she told them she was going to bet
24:27
on herself and take no salary for the
24:30
first two years if the investor was
24:32
willing to bet on them and that was for
24:34
a 25 000 check her first round of
24:37
funding for the company was only five
24:38
hundred thousand dollars but she got it
24:40
done and she got even though she got
24:41
rejected over and over again and since
24:43
then the company was acquired for 275
24:46
million dollars so here's this awesome
24:48
medical device company that sold for
24:51
hundreds of millions of dollars and yet
24:53
rejection after rejection after
24:55
rejection if you want to read more about
24:57
serbi's story she actually has an
24:58
awesome book coming out in the spring
25:00
and it's on Amazon right now and we'll
25:02
share the link with you in the chat if
25:04
you want to check it out and pre-order
25:05
it Serbia is awesome it's a privilege to
25:07
get to work with her and the book is
25:09
terrific one other example of this is
25:12
what not it's a Marketplace for
25:14
Collectibles they were in the winter 20
25:16
batch and they came in with a beta
25:18
product but no users they hadn't
25:19
launched yet and during the batch they
25:21
got started and it was just initially a
25:24
Marketplace for selling funko pop toys
25:26
toys with the big heads during the batch
25:28
they got some early traction they
25:31
started making some money they got in
25:32
some buyers they got in some sellers
25:34
Revenue was going up sales were going up
25:36
things were looking good right but
25:38
investors hated it and they only raised
25:42
a fraction of the amount of money that
25:44
they were hoping to raise for their seed
25:46
round and the amazing thing is is that
25:48
today what not just two and a half years
25:50
later is worth 3.7 billion dollars and
25:54
they've raised over 400 million dollars
25:56
and just two and a half years ago they
25:58
couldn't pay people to invest in their
26:00
company at a fraction of that valuation
26:02
everyone gets rejected it's just part of
26:04
it even if you're building a four
26:06
billion dollar company people are
26:08
getting rejected and the thing is the
26:10
founders were not really that bummed out
26:11
about it because they had already done
26:13
that work of convincing themselves that
26:15
what they were building was working and
26:17
was going to work investors just weren't
26:19
seeing it yet some did enough did but
26:22
they still faced a ton of rejection you
26:24
don't need every investor to like what
26:25
you're building you just need a few of
26:28
them to believe and the good news is
26:30
that today there's more investors than
26:32
ever with more money than ever looking
26:34
to invest in startups all right let's
Wrap up - This isn't for you
26:36
step back for a second and wrap this up
26:38
there's a common theme to these myths
26:40
that we talked about the idea that
26:42
organizes all of these is the big myth
26:45
which is this
26:46
this isn't for you these ideas that are
26:49
out there these misconceptions the
26:50
founders have they add up to people
26:52
thinking gosh maybe this isn't for me
26:54
maybe I shouldn't start my startup
26:56
because I don't know how to do this
26:58
stuff I don't have a fancy Network I I
27:00
don't know all these people I don't know
27:01
how to pitch I don't know how to impress
27:03
people but the reality is you can do
27:05
this fundraising is just a bunch of
27:07
coffee chats and zoom calls you
27:10
you don't need to raise money to get
27:12
started you can just start working on
27:13
your startup you don't need permission
27:14
from investors you don't need an
27:16
intricate pitch you just need to make
27:18
something people want and be able to
27:20
talk about it like a normal human you do
27:22
that every day with your friends and
27:23
family using safes it's easier than ever
27:25
for you to go raise the money that you
27:27
need without lawyers and quickly and the
27:29
terms you're going to get today mean
27:31
that you can run your company exactly
27:33
how you want there's not some secret
27:35
special way that you have to run your
27:36
startup you can call the shots you don't
27:39
need a big Network and fancy connections
27:40
to raise money and finally the rejection
27:43
that you're going to experience doesn't
27:45
mean anything it's just part of the
27:47
process it turns out there's never been
27:49
a better time in the history of the
27:51
world to raise money than now so if
27:53
you're thinking of doing a startup
27:55
get building you can do this you can do
27:58
all of this you can do this
28:01
