Launching Your Startup

[Music]
0:10
head of Outreach at y combinator so I've
0:14
been at YC for about nine years now and
0:16
that means I've seen over 3 500
0:18
companies go through the program and
0:20
launch at YC one of the things my team
0:23
does is help companies with their first
0:25
launches and today I want to change the
0:28
way you think about launching most
0:31
Founders overthink their first launch
0:33
they think they have just one shot at
0:36
launching their product publicly and
0:38
that the messaging has to be perfect or
0:40
that no one will ever buy or use or
0:44
invest in their product
0:45
I talked to Founders constantly who
0:48
lovingly prepare their launch for months
0:51
but if you're like most startups you'll
0:54
launch something and no one will care
0:56
and if it takes you six months to get
0:58
the first version of your product in
1:00
front of anyone your startup may be dead
1:02
before you get another chance to launch
1:04
So In The Same Spirit of always be
1:07
shipping I want you to think about
1:09
launching as something that you do
1:11
continually so here's what we're going
1:13
to talk about today first we'll talk
1:15
about when to launch and why second
1:17
we'll walk through some strong one-line
1:19
company descriptions including some that
1:22
I pulled from the startup School
1:23
community and third we'll talk about the
1:25
types of launches you can do during
1:27
startup school so first a lot of people
When Should I Launch My Startup?
1:30
ask when should I launch and the answer
1:33
is ASAP it's probably right now why so
1:38
Founders are really good at lying to
1:41
themselves a lot of you have really
1:43
strong convictions about what you're
1:45
building and that's good Founders need
1:48
that conviction but many of you have
1:50
strong but theoretical Notions of how
1:53
you're going to solve a problem and how
1:55
people are going to interact with what
1:57
you're building so putting your product
1:59
out there even in its earliest state
2:01
will help you determine whether you're
2:03
solving a big enough problem that
2:05
someone is willing to pay for you or use
2:07
you even in the products really
2:10
unpolished state so if you launch too
2:13
early what's the worst case scenario
2:16
what's the worst thing that can happen
2:17
people might think the product is ugly
2:20
or it sucks investors might hear about
2:23
the product before it's ready you know
2:24
competitors might see it or Worse no one
2:28
will see it or no one will care and
2:30
that's fine just launch again
2:33
Airbnb launched three times before they
2:36
really started to get users launching
2:38
and having no one care that feels
2:40
terrible but it's not a reason to give
2:42
up it's a reason to iterate and launch
2:45
again launch and iterate launch and
2:48
iterate until you have a core of users
2:50
who really love you Paul Buchheit he's
2:53
the creator of Gmail and a long time YC
2:56
group partner he has said it's better to
2:58
make a few people really happy than to
3:01
make a lot of people semi-happy
3:04
so early on as long as you've made
3:06
something that a few users absolutely
3:09
love you are on the right track it'll be
3:13
good for your morale to have even a
3:14
handful of users who really love what
3:16
you're doing and it'll help you figure
3:19
out what to focus on
3:20
what is it about your product that they
3:22
love and how can you do more of that
3:25
where can you find more users who love
3:28
that sort of thing that you're doing if
3:30
you have a core of users even 10 users
3:32
who really love you all you have to do
3:34
is expand that number and it might take
3:36
a while but if you keep going cockroach
3:39
style you can win in the end so now that
One Sentence Pitch
3:42
we've determined you should all launch
3:44
let's talk about something every one of
3:47
you needs before you launch to create a
3:50
strong one sentence pitch you need
3:53
Clarity of vision
3:54
we believe that people who have thought
3:56
deeply and about about an idea can
3:59
explain it clearly and succinctly they
4:02
use less words they can explain con
4:05
complex Concepts in a way that a
4:07
five-year-old can understand and having
4:09
a clear idea is important because a
4:12
clear idea is the best foundation for
4:14
growth the best companies and movements
4:17
grow organically by word of mouth and
4:20
that's good news because Word of Mouth
4:22
growth is the cheapest way to grow and
4:24
if you think back to the first time you
4:26
heard about something like say tick tock
4:27
or a slack there's a good chance you've
4:30
heard about it through a friend or
4:32
co-worker talking about what you do
4:34
clearly and succinctly is going to be
4:36
one of your most important jobs as a
4:38
Founder it's a skill that you'll need to
4:41
convince potential co-founders investors
4:44
users employees and eventually hopefully
4:47
shareholders to believe in you it's also
4:50
a skill you'll need to grow to grow you
4:52
need to get all these groups of people
4:53
talking about you to help you spread the
4:56
word that's why it's necessary to make
4:58
it easy for anyone your grandfather or
5:00
the person that you meet at the airport
5:02
to talk about what you're doing so that
5:05
word can spread about you virally when
5:07
people sit down at the dinner table they
5:09
should be talking about you and your
5:11
company and you don't have to be
5:13
naturally good at talking about your
5:14
company at first it takes some of our
5:16
Founders at YC months to get comfortable
5:18
doing this so here's how we think about
How to Create a Short Memorable Description
5:20
coming up with a short memorable
5:22
description of your company so first we
5:25
recommend leading with what not with why
5:28
and this may seem counterintuitive
5:31
because we tell most stories
5:33
chronologically it's natural to start
5:36
with you know how you discover the
5:38
problem you're solving and why it's
5:40
important
5:41
and one reason a lot of you do this is
5:43
because you're all very ambitious people
5:45
and you want to solve these big problems
5:47
and that's really awesome and Founders
5:49
need that ambition but
5:51
when you only have a limited time with
5:54
someone it's important to give them
5:55
context up front so start with the
5:58
company name and what you do and there's
6:00
no need to set up the problem just get
6:02
to the point so I'll use a real example
6:05
from a YC companies application the
6:07
company is called pave if they'd started
6:09
with why they were building this company
6:11
they would have said many of my friends
6:13
are super confused about their stock
6:15
options and it pisses me off how
6:18
stressed they get thinking about them
6:19
but before you give me the back story
6:21
again start with one sentence that tells
6:23
me what you're building First Press
6:25
people and investors and even other
6:28
Founders get pitched tens of times per
6:31
you know per day definitely per week and
6:34
they have particularly short attention
6:36
spans so here's the actual description
6:39
of the company pave pave lets companies
6:41
plan communicate and Benchmark your
6:44
compensation in real time this is a
6:47
straightforward description of what
6:48
they're building and who they're
6:49
building for they are building 2 tools
6:52
to make compensation and pay more
6:54
transparent for companies uh and and
6:57
their employees so hopefully whoever
6:59
you're talking to asks follow-up
7:02
questions and then you can get to the
7:04
why later so the second mistake Founders
7:07
make is adding a lot of meaningless
7:09
marketing speak to their pitches so this
7:11
is a tweet from Gary tan he said
7:13
meaningless jargon is the number one
7:16
issue I spend time trying to fight when
7:18
helping startups so here is an actual
7:21
description of a company don't worry
7:23
it's not a startup School company or a
7:25
YC company indiecloud is a know-how and
7:28
Synergy platform don't say like
7:31
this it has zero informational content
7:33
about what you actually do when you're
7:36
describing your company the person
7:38
you're talking to should have some idea
7:40
of you know what they'd have to build to
7:42
reproduce what you're talking about a
7:45
know-how Synergy platform could
7:46
literally be anything it could be a
7:48
collaborative edtech company or it could
7:50
be a Marketplace for experts like you
7:53
literally have no idea what you what
7:54
you'd have to build to reproduce a
7:57
know-how Synergy platform another
7:59
mistake Founders make is rambling they
8:01
just go on and on and on and don't do
8:03
this the person you're talking to will
8:05
have already zoned out so here's the
8:08
actual description Airbnb used on their
8:10
YC application we built the first Online
8:13
Marketplace that lets Travelers book
8:15
room to locals instead of hotels this is
8:18
a tight description it describes the
8:21
problem they're solving and who they're
8:22
solving it for so here's one I pulled
8:25
from the startup School Forum open queue
8:28
find and talk to your target B2B users
8:31
fast again they tell you the problem
8:33
they're solving and who they're solving
8:36
it for they're making it easy for B2B
8:38
companies to reach potential customers
8:40
and you can sort of imagine what you
8:42
might have to build to reproduce what
8:44
they're doing okay here's another one I
8:46
pulled from the startup School Forum yum
8:49
it's a clever name adaptive ml driven
8:51
mental health for your team and I get
8:53
this what this is It's a digital mental
8:56
health tools to help your team cope with
8:58
stress and burnout but I think you can
9:01
Workshop it a little bit if you're
9:03
showing this to potential customers I
9:05
think they'll care less about the fact
9:07
that the product is ml driven and more
9:09
about the fact that it's personalized
9:11
digital therapy so I I changed it up to
9:13
personalized digital therapy programs
9:16
for your team some people ask me whether
When is the X for Y Construction Not Too Cliche?
9:18
the X for y construction is too cliche
9:21
to use when describing their company and
9:24
let's be honest the term you know Uber
9:27
for x or Airbnb B for X has been a bit
9:29
overused
9:30
I want to emphasize that all of you
9:32
should have a one-line description that
9:34
does not use the X for y construction
9:36
but the X for y construction can be used
9:40
in certain cases so for example paisy
9:43
which is a YC Alum can describe
9:46
themselves as stripe for his former
9:48
Soviet Union countries but they could
9:50
also describe themselves as payment
9:53
processing for former Soviet countries
9:55
but let's talk about when it's okay to
9:58
use the X for y Construction
10:00
going back to paisy if the founders are
10:03
talking to people in Silicon Valley so
10:05
investors or press for example uh then
10:08
it might make sense you might use the X
10:10
for y analogy if it really is the best
10:13
way to paint a picture of what you're
10:15
building very quickly if you go with
10:17
this construction you need three
10:19
ingredients first of all X should be a
10:22
household name
10:24
second it should be reasonably clear why
10:26
y might want X
10:28
and third y should be a huge market so
10:32
one YC company described themselves
10:34
early on as buffer for Snapchat even
10:37
know buffer is doing well as a company
10:39
it's not a company that not everyone
10:41
necessarily knows when I was reading
10:43
this description in their YC application
10:45
I literally had to go to Google and
10:47
Google buffer so in this case you're
10:49
better off describing the problem that
10:52
you're solving so here's an X for y
10:54
example from the startup School
10:55
community that I think works hark alive
10:57
is Airbnb for dance and movement classes
11:00
it paints a fast picture of what Harker
11:03
live is but honestly you could also just
11:05
as easily say harkalive is a Marketplace
11:08
for dance and movement classes so to
11:10
review the best one-liners are
11:12
descriptive they describe what you do
11:14
the problem and who you're solving it
11:16
for
11:17
they're conversational and don't use
11:19
jargon or marketing language and there's
11:21
no long-winded lead up they're concise
11:24
short and sweet so now that you know
11:27
what you need for a good one sentence
11:29
pitch let's talk about why you want to
11:32
launch continuously even before you have
11:34
a fully functioning product
11:36
launching early gives you the chance to
11:39
practice and refine your idea you can a
11:42
B test the idea or messaging on people
11:44
you get an opportunity to see how people
11:47
respond to it and then once you have a
11:50
product launching through different
11:51
channels will give you an opportunity to
11:54
see how people respond to the actual
11:55
product and launching on different
11:57
channels will also help you determine
11:59
whether you're even talking to the right
12:01
users different channels will naturally
12:03
reach different audiences so let's talk
Types of Launches
12:06
about some of the types of launches you
12:09
can do in your early stages here are
12:11
different types of launches and I'm
12:12
going to go through each one of these
12:14
briefly so first is the silent launch
12:17
and this is something every one of you
12:19
should do while you're in startup school
12:20
I clicked on 10 random startup School
12:23
companies today and only half of them
12:25
had landing pages so you don't need
12:28
anything fancy at the very least you
12:31
need a domain name your company name a
12:33
short description a way for users to
12:36
contact you and a call to action your
12:38
call to action might be sign up for a
12:40
newsletter or sign up to here when we
12:42
launch here's an example of a startup
12:44
School company landing page Lara they
12:47
have their domain name a company name
12:49
short description and a call to action
12:51
sign up for the wait list and this is
12:54
all you really need the next type of
12:56
launch is to friends and family
12:58
even if you're at idea stage you can
13:00
test out your one to two sentence pitch
13:02
on friends and family and once you have
13:04
an MVP you should do a friends and
13:07
family launch as quickly as possible so
13:10
in its earliest days Reddit was shared
13:13
among the founders of the first YC batch
13:16
I use the Wayback machine to find the
13:18
earliest view of Reddit I can find from
13:20
2005. so this was even before they
13:23
called upvotes upvotes so share your
13:26
product with friends and family watch
13:28
them use the product and ask them for
13:30
feedback but one thing about the friends
13:32
and family launch don't stay in this
13:34
phase for too long because your friends
13:36
and family might not be the ideal users
13:38
for what you're building and sometimes
13:40
their feedback isn't going to be as
13:42
helpful as a real users next type of
13:45
launch launching to strangers I want to
13:48
share the MVP for doordash this is the
13:50
very first version of the doordash site
13:52
when they first started out the founders
13:54
were building other things they were
13:56
building tech for small business owners
13:58
and so they started approaching store
14:00
owners for feedback and they spent a lot
14:03
of time talking to this one store
14:05
manager Chloe she was the manager of a
14:07
macaron store in Downtown Palo Alto in
14:10
talking to Chloe they realized that the
14:11
app they were building really didn't
14:13
solve any of her problems but just as
14:15
they were about to leave Chloe always
14:16
said hey there's just one thing I want
14:18
to show you and it was this thick
14:20
booklet with pages and pages of pages of
14:23
delivery orders
14:24
she said this drives me crazy I have no
14:26
drivers to fulfill them and I'm the one
14:28
doing all the deliveries over the course
14:30
of the next few weeks the founders
14:32
interviewed over 200 small business
14:35
owners across the bay area and they kept
14:37
hearing the same issue deliveries are
14:40
painful
14:41
then after they you know absorbed enough
14:44
information about the product they built
14:46
this their MVP in just a few hours
14:50
so if they'd waited too long to get
14:53
direct feedback from their customers
14:54
they might have spent way longer you
14:56
know six months plus building out the
14:59
wrong solution for small business owners
15:01
so I'd recommend you get out there even
15:03
if it makes you slightly uncomfortable
15:04
and start talking to your potential
15:06
customers as soon as possible do what
15:08
doordash did and talk to 200. so next is
15:11
one of my favorite ways to launch
15:13
through online communities so I think
15:16
you should plan a launch for every
15:17
single community that you are part of
15:19
when a company goes through YC for
15:21
example they have the option of
15:23
launching on Bookface before they launch
15:25
publicly Bookface is our internal
15:27
platform for Founders it's like Facebook
15:29
meets LinkedIn meets quora all for YC
15:32
Founders and there are currently over 6
15:35
000 Founders on bookbase so for many
15:37
companies in YC it's a good way to get
15:39
some first users and some early feedback
15:42
and it's a fairly low risk way to launch
15:44
because you're launching in front of a
15:46
friendly community of other Founders
15:47
there are countless examples of
15:49
companies that have launched and gotten
15:51
their first or first thousand customers
15:53
through online communities another
15:55
community that you have access to is
15:57
Hacker News they have something called
15:59
show hn so many YC alumni Dropbox and
16:03
git lab for example and hundreds more
16:05
have launched on Hacker News Robin Hood
16:08
is an example of another company that
16:10
successfully launched on hn so back in
16:13
December 2013 they had a really simple
16:15
site and all it said was commission free
16:18
trading stop paying up to ten dollars
16:20
per trade
16:21
at the time they only had a button that
16:24
let you join a waitlist the waitlist
16:26
would show you how many people were
16:28
ahead of you in line and how many people
16:29
were behind you in line
16:31
so it was a Friday night and they'd been
16:33
working on building this wait list in
16:35
preparation for a launch they were
16:37
planning the following week with someone
16:39
totally random posted them on hn and
16:41
boom they got to number one on hn and
16:44
ended up getting 10 000 signups the
16:46
first day and then over 50 000 over the
16:49
next week so each Community is different
16:52
they have different tones audiences
16:54
interests launched communities you're
16:57
genuinely genuinely engaged with so be
17:00
authentic don't get bogged down and too
17:03
much marketing and promo language people
17:06
these days just shut off when they see
17:08
that do your research and get an
17:10
understanding of what will compel
17:12
members of that Community to be
17:13
interested in what you're doing so we
17:15
don't have time to do a huge Deep dive
17:18
into these next types of launches but I
17:20
wanted to skim them briefly and share
17:23
some resources and things that I found
17:24
recently so in a q a we did with the
17:27
replit founders a few weeks ago you
17:29
asked amjad and Haya how did you get
17:31
your first users and they said you just
17:34
have to be everywhere Hacker News
17:36
Twitter Reddit Etc so I wanted to share
17:40
a thread that YC Alum Catherine cross
17:42
tweeted out about building her community
17:44
on Tick Tock Anja Health Catherine's
17:46
company helps parents freeze their
17:48
babies umbilical cords and placentas for
17:50
there's some stuff for their stem cells
17:52
so she wrote This Thread about how she
17:55
committed to posting tick tocks to start
17:57
building a community in advance of the
17:59
company's launch and in just a month she
18:02
hit 10 000 followers so she shared this
18:04
thread on tips for building a community
18:07
on Tick Tock which uh we will link to in
18:10
the chat there is of course the
18:12
pre-order launch and if you are a
18:15
hardware or product or physical product
18:17
you can do a pre-order campaign on a
18:19
platform like Kickstarter or Indiegogo
18:22
so preparing uh for a pre-order launch
18:25
could honestly be a whole presentation
18:27
of its own and honestly there's a little
18:30
bit more skepticism about crowdfunding
18:32
and pre-orders than there was say five
18:34
years ago so it's worth thinking about
18:36
whether it's the right thing for your
18:38
company but YC Alum ship Bob wrote a
18:42
guide on pre-orders that talks about why
18:44
you should or should not consider doing
18:46
this type of campaign there are a lot of
18:48
great you know sort of guides that walk
18:50
you through uh pre-order campaigns and
18:52
how to prepare for them online as well
18:53
all right and then there's the waitlist
18:55
launch we talked about a really good
18:57
example of that with Robin Hood earlier
18:59
and there are other examples like
19:01
superhuman uh that launch successfully
19:03
with a wait list one note on the
19:06
waitlist launch the longer you wait to
19:08
launch an actual product and the longer
19:11
you wait to onboard people the harder it
19:14
is to convert people from your waitlist
19:16
so please don't sit on your waitlist for
19:19
too long okay so why are we not going to
19:23
talk about press it all in this talk
19:25
these days if you were an early stage
19:27
company that hasn't raised you know say
19:29
a million or more it's going to be
19:32
incredibly hard to land press stories at
19:34
least in the U.S but that said even if
19:37
you do land press it's not a silver
19:39
bullet it's not a scalable way to get
19:42
users it might help you get in front of
19:44
some early users and investors but as
19:46
you see press can't be counted on for
19:49
sustained growth it will not get you to
19:52
product Market fit so don't spend a ton
19:55
of your time during startup School
19:56
worrying about getting press what I do
19:58
want to emphasize is while you're in
20:01
startup school you should start to build
20:03
your own Community it can be as simple
20:06
as starting an email list of your
20:07
supporters and figuring out you know how
20:10
to engage them on an ongoing basis and
20:13
you may be surprised who reads the email
20:15
and shows up to help and in the future
20:16
every time you release a new product or
20:19
a new feature you can use all these
20:22
channels to launch on them again
20:24
stripe has always been great at engaging
20:27
with the community each time a new
20:29
product launches they blog about it
20:32
they've the founders get on Hacker News
20:34
and they talk to the hn community they
20:36
spread the word on social media they
20:38
pitch press
20:39
stripe they are Masters at launching
20:42
again and again so to sum up I want you
Summary
20:45
to stop thinking about launching as just
20:48
one moment in time if you launch and no
20:51
one pays attention do what Airbnb did
20:54
and launch again and again
20:58
