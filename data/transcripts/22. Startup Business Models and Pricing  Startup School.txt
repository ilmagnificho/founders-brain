I'm Aaron Epstein I'm a group partner here at Y combinator and in this video we're going to be talking about business
Outline
0:15
models and pricing there's three main things that we're going to cover in this video the first is the nine business
0:21
models of nearly every billion dollar company it turns out there's just a handful of them that build the biggest
0:27
winners next we're going to talk about business model lessons from the YC top 100 companies list and finally we're
0:34
going to cover some startup pricing insights that we've taken from the thousands of companies that have gone
0:41
through YC so first let's talk about business models that build winners if you're not familiar a business model is
9 business models that build billion-dollar companies
0:48
a fancy term for how you make money and it turns out the business models are important because we see Founders that
0:54
often get frustrated when investors won't fund them and their business won't grow and oftentimes they're not sure why
1:02
and usually this is because they're not using a proven business model and they're actually only a handful of
1:08
business models that are responsible for nearly all billion dollar companies and rather than trying to reinvent the wheel
1:14
you should actually just copy one of these and here they are nearly every
1:20
billion dollar company is one of these Nine business models there's SAS business models which is software as a
1:26
service which is cloud-based subscription software that customers pay either monthly or annually in order to
1:33
access the software there's transactional business models that facilitate transactions and take a cut
1:40
of those transactions these are often fintech companies and then there's marketplaces which facilitate
1:46
transactions between buyers and sellers these are often referred to as two-sided marketplaces and there's also hard tech
1:53
businesses there's usage-based business models there's Enterprise there's
1:58
advertising there's e-commerce and there's bio and so in this video I'm
2:04
actually not going to get too deep into the specifics of each of these business models instead we're going to have a
2:10
business model guide that I've put together that's going to be linked in the description down below this guide is going to cover the metrics that matter
2:17
most for each business model key takeaways for each of them and other
2:23
similar companies that you can learn from depending on which business model you are using for your company in this
Business model lessons from the top 100 YC companies
2:29
video what I want to focus on is things that we can learn from the top 100 YC companies the top 100 YC companies is
2:37
pulled from y combinator.com top companies which is a list of the most
2:43
valuable companies that y combinator has ever funded and so for the purposes of
2:48
this video I've gone through this list and I've matched each company up with
2:53
their primary business model to try to see what interesting insights we can get from them now some later stage and
3:01
larger companies actually have multiple business models however for your purposes as an early stage startup you
3:08
should just have a single business model that you're focused on and so here they are these are the top 100 YC companies
3:14
organized by business model and there's some interesting things that we see here first is that that SAS businesses
3:21
actually make up 31 of the top 100 YC companies transactional businesses make
3:27
up 22 percent of the top 100 YC companies and marketplaces actually make
3:33
up 14 so just with these three business models SAS transactional and
3:39
marketplaces it makes up 67 percent of the top 100 YC companies on the flip
3:45
side with business models like advertising and e-commerce they barely register on the top 100 YC companies
3:53
list if you're familiar with startup outcomes and Venture Capital returns you
3:58
know that there's a power law effect which means that the biggest winners far far outperform all other businesses by
4:06
orders of magnitude and this is true for the YC top 100 companies list as well turns out that 50 of the overall value
4:14
of the top 100 YC companies actually comes from just the top ten and so it's
4:20
interesting to look at what insights we can get from these 10 companies too and here they are these are the top 10 YC
4:27
companies by value there's Airbnb there's stripe there's instacart there's
4:33
coinbase there's doordash there's Reddit there's a number of companies here that
4:39
you're probably very familiar with or use on a regular basis and what's especially interesting is that five of
4:45
the YC top 10 are actually marketplaces there's Airbnb there's instacart there's
4:52
doordash there's openc and there's Fair the interesting takeaway here is that
4:57
marketplaces are most likely to build winner take all companies they tend to become so big and dominant in their
5:04
industry that it doesn't leave much room or market share for other competitors once marketplaces actually get huge so
5:12
marketplaces are 14 of the top 100 companies but they actually create 30 of
5:18
the overall value because so many are represented here in the top ten and while marketplaces are really tough to
5:24
get off the ground they have a chicken and egg problem where you can't just build your product and then sell it to
5:30
customers you actually need to solve for both sides of the marketplace the supply and the demand at the same time in order
5:37
to get customers however once they hit the inflection point and they start to
5:43
work they get massive Network effects where each new user of the platform
5:48
increases the value for everybody else that's what makes them dominant winners so you can think of companies like
5:54
Airbnb if you are looking to rent out a place short term to stay then chances
6:00
are you would go to Airbnb because that's where all the inventory is similarly if you wanted to buy or sell
6:06
nfts you would probably go to openc because that's where everyone is that's
6:11
how these become the big Winners it also turns out that three of the YC top 10 are transactional businesses too so
6:19
these are companies like stripe coinbase and brex and the main takeaway here is
6:24
that transactional business is far outperform because they're directly in the flow of funds this means that they
6:31
are the platform that money flows through making it very easy for them to just take their cut and so transactional
6:39
companies are 22 of the top 100 YC companies but they actually create 29 of
6:46
the overall value and this is because there is close to the transaction as possible this was advice that I received
6:53
during my YC batch back in 2010 and that was to get as close to the
6:58
transaction as possible if you're a company like stripe that literally processes money for companies or brex
7:06
that is the corporate card that they use to spend money then you're directly in that flow of funds and so it's really
7:13
easy to take your cut on the opposite extreme if you are an affiliate business multiple things have to happen before
7:20
you ultimately get paid which means that you are very far from the transaction which makes those not as good of a
7:26
business for transactional businesses because they're so close to the transaction they often become critical
7:32
infrastructure for other companies that they build on top of and that usually means that they are solving a top three
7:39
problem for them so you can imagine if you use stripe as your primary method to
7:44
get paid from your customers the thought of ripping that out sounds terrible you
7:50
would never want to do that and that's why these transactional businesses become so dominant we also see that SAS
7:56
businesses are most likely to make the top 100 list and this is because they have consistent Revenue so 31 of the YC
8:05
top 100 companies are actually SAS businesses that's nearly a third and this is because the recurring Revenue
8:12
makes them great businesses this means that customers keep paying them every
8:17
single month or every single year until the customer explicitly says to stop so
8:23
this has lots of benefits including the predictable Revenue that they get which allows them to compound and grow their
8:30
business we can also see that very few advertising businesses become big Winners and this may be surprising
8:36
because we're so familiar with so many companies that have built their business off of an advertising business model
8:43
there's Google there's Facebook there's Twitter just to name a few but really
8:48
only three percent of the top 100 YC companies use an advertising business
8:54
model as their primary way to make money and that's because advertising businesses need organic virality to win
9:00
they need to catch lightning in a bottle and become the Hub where all users go to
9:06
to hang out or to see live streams in the case of twitch but when that happens they get really strong Network effects
9:13
just like marketplaces so people go to hangout on Reddit and form communities
9:18
there because that's where everybody else is people go to Twitch to watch live streams because that's where all
9:24
the streamers are and so it's really important to remember member that you should not use ads as your primary
9:31
business model unless you expect to be a top 10 site on the internet otherwise
9:36
it's too hard to monetize and build a huge scale to become a massive company so what are some overall lessons that we
Overall lessons
9:44
can take away from this list first it's interesting to look at what's not in the top 100 list there are no services or
9:51
Consulting businesses there and so it can be a good idea to start doing services or Consulting for your
9:58
customers primarily as a way to learn and make sure that you're building the right product for them but Consulting
10:03
businesses suffer from having non-recurring Revenue scaling with people rather than software
10:09
and having very low margins as a result so that's why these businesses are not
10:15
Venture scale similarly affiliate businesses they tend to be too far away from the transaction that means that you
10:22
have to acquire a customer so send them off to another product or service hope
10:27
that they actually make a transaction on that other product or you will get some small commission from that 30 to 90 days
10:34
later so it's too hard to make a lot of money at scale doing an affiliate business similarly Hardware businesses
10:41
they require lots of capital to get off the ground to buy physical parts and
10:46
they have low margins as a result so that makes it really difficult to start these businesses and also to scale them
10:53
even if they're working just requires so much capital and then businesses that are built on other platforms you don't
11:00
see in this list either that's because they tend to have a lot of platform risk if your business is built on top of
11:07
another big successful platform and your business starts to work then it's actually in the interest of that
11:13
platform to shut you down and capture all of that revenue for themselves so
11:18
that's why even if these look like they're working in the early days they can be turned off at any moment we also
11:24
see that recurring Revenue consistently creates winners and this is because it
11:29
is highly predictable once a customer has committed to pay they're going to continue paying until they explicitly
11:36
say that they want to stop paying they also have higher customer lifetime values versus one-off transactions and
11:43
this results in lower customer acquisition costs so you don't have to keep reacquiring customers over and over
11:49
if you have a one-off transactional business then you have to invest money in acquiring that customer the first
11:56
time and then also keep putting more money into trying to get existing
12:01
customers to spend more with you that's not the case with recurring Revenue businesses but recurring Revenue only
12:09
works when you have strong retention it's not enough for your product to deliver value right up front and then
12:16
never again you need to keep delivering value over and over again otherwise your customers will churn and stop paying and
12:24
then you can't scale a leaky bucket if you have lots of churn and to give you an example of that if you had 95 monthly
12:30
retention for your recurring Revenue product so that means that five percent of your customers will churn and stop
12:38
paying you every single month and if you started with 100 customers at the beginning of the year then by the end of
12:45
the year you would only have 54 customers of your original 100. that
12:50
means that you would lose 46 of your customers in just one year and you would
12:55
need to get 46 new customers just to break even with where you started the
13:00
year and let's say for example you had 90 monthly retention instead of 95 just
13:06
a five percent difference there and that would actually lead to only 28 customers
13:11
at the end of that first year that's a huge difference and a huge hill to climb
13:17
so just that five percent difference in monthly retention can actually be the
13:22
difference between life and death for a startup we can also see that some of the
13:27
biggest winners are built with Moats there are network effects that many
13:32
marketplaces have right where each new user increases the value and they become
13:37
the dominant player in the market there's also lock-in and high switching costs we see this with transactional
13:44
businesses like stripe if you're the primary way that people actually accept money and process payments then chances
13:52
are they're not going to switch off of you in SAS businesses you get the recurring Revenue where customers keep
13:58
paying over and over again until they say to stop you can also get lock in by having
14:04
customer data on your platform that once they stop paying all that customer data goes away
14:09
and then Enterprise businesses while they're often difficult and have long sales Cycles to be able to sell into
14:15
large companies usually once you've sold into the company the churn is a lot lower technical Innovation is another
14:23
way to build really strong modes and we see this often in hard tech and bio companies especially so you can think of
14:30
companies like Cruise building self-driving cars and boom which is building supersonic Jets it takes a
14:37
really long time to even get to a working product for these types of businesses and So for anybody to compete
14:44
with them it takes years of difficult technical development just to catch up
14:49
we also see that higher margins and better Union economics can build modes in the example of companies like
14:55
doordash and instacart they've reached economies of scale where they're so large now that they've been able to
15:02
drive their costs further down at this scale and improve their margins which
15:07
new entrants are not going to be able to compete with and finally if you get organic distribution for your product
15:13
through virality or Word of Mouth you can dominate your Market through that as
15:18
well if you are able to get users for free because other users of your product tell
15:25
new users to come join and you're competing with a company that has to pay to acquire their customers then you are
15:32
going to grow much faster and capture way more of the market so to recap the
15:37
best businesses generate recurring Revenue have high retention build defensible moats are as close to
15:45
the transaction as possible they scale with software not people and they're proven and use business
15:52
models that are familiar to customers and so it's important that you focus on innovating on your product that's what
16:00
should be new and copying your business model from one of these proven winners
5 pricing insights from top YC companies
16:06
all right now let's talk about pricing it's important to think of pricing as a tool to help you learn faster it can
16:13
help teach you who wants your product how much they want it how much value
16:18
your product provides to your users and which channels you can afford to use to
16:24
acquire your customers so to help you get started I've compiled five pricing insights from
16:31
the top YC companies the first is you should charge this is actually the most
16:36
common mistake that we see Founders make often Founders are afraid to charge for
16:42
a number of reasons they're often afraid that their customers are going to tell them no they're afraid that their
16:48
customers are going to walk away and never come back and they're afraid that their customers are actually going to go
16:53
and use their competitors product but it turns out that charging is actually one of the most effective ways to learn a
16:59
lot of really important things about your business the first is are your users even willing to pay or not this is
17:06
often binary where either they're willing to open their wallet or they don't even see enough value in your
17:12
product to overcome that hurdle it can also teach you which users are most willing to pay if you're trying to
17:18
decide whether you should go after customer segment a or customer segment B trying to charge and figuring out which
17:25
one is most excited to pay can give you really good signal on Who wants your product more it can also teach you how
17:32
much they're willing to pay by setting higher prices you can try to figure out how much value they see in your product
17:38
even if everyone refuses to pay that's still valuable information for you to
17:44
get because it teaches you that you haven't built enough value into your product yet or you're talking to the
17:49
wrong customer segment stripe is a great example of this in the early days
17:54
stripe wanted to test the amount of value that they were building in their product so while most of their
18:00
competitors were actually charging around three percent per transaction stripe decided to set their price at
18:07
five percent per transaction nearly double what their competitors were charging and the reason that they did
18:12
this is because they wanted to test how much value their customers saw in things
18:17
like one-click sign up and being able to get started quickly and really in-depth
18:23
detailed developer API documentation that would help developers get started
18:28
faster and so rather than trying to undercut the competition in order to win customers they did the exact opposite
18:35
and set a really high bar for themselves to prove that they had built enough value into their product so where should
18:43
you begin the first thing that I recommend is that you don't overthink it if you look online there are tons of charts and
18:50
graphs and formulas and all these different complicated ways to maximize your pricing and figure out the right
18:56
price to charge but really when you're just getting started the important thing is to just find the right order of
19:02
magnitude for your pricing and what I mean by that is if you're charging ten dollars for your product and your
19:08
customers are willing to pay a hundred you should probably change your price you're off by an order of magnitude
19:13
however if you're charging ten dollars and your customers are willing to pay 15 or 20 don't worry about it you're in the
19:21
right ballpark which is the really important thing and pricing isn't permanent this is really important it
19:28
often takes years to iterate and capture the full value of the product that you've built from your customers and so
19:35
don't worry about capturing that full value early on you'll have plenty of time to maximize that the next Insight
19:41
is that you should price on value not on cost and so there's three important
19:46
components here the first is the cost this is what it costs you to be able to
19:52
serve your customer the next variable is price this is what you're charging and then there's the perceived value
19:58
that your customers see in your product and so Founders often start with
20:04
something called Cost Plus pricing I would not recommend this what this usually looks like is looking at how
20:10
much it costs you to serve a customer and then adding an amount on top of that say ten dollars and that's your price
20:16
but this actually ignores the full value of what your customers see in your
20:22
product so the difference between your cost to serve your customer and the
20:27
price that you charge that's your margin that's how much you make on each transaction and the difference between
20:33
the price and the value that your customers see in your product
20:39
that's your opportunity to be able to raise your prices to be able to capture
20:44
more of that perceived value and now if your cost is higher than your price
20:49
well that means that you're going to have negative margins and you cannot scale a business with negative margins
20:55
similarly if your price is higher than the value that your customers see in
21:00
your product that means they're just not going to buy from you so how do you find your value well there's a couple
21:06
interesting ways to be able to do this the first is talk to your users you can
21:11
ask them about the problem that you solve and get them to articulate the value to you and so what this often
21:18
looks like is if you reach out to a customer and you get them on a call and you can ask them what is the problem
21:24
that you are hoping that our product could solve for you and they'll often tell you and similarly if you have a
21:31
user that's signed up for your product but is not actually paying you you can reach out to them and talk to them and
21:37
ask them the question what problem were you hoping that our product could solve for you and their
21:43
response is usually going to be one of four interesting things the first is they're probably going to
21:49
tell you that they were hoping you could help them make more money this is something every company wants
21:55
or they might tell you that they were hoping that you could help reduce costs maybe your product saves them time or
22:02
money they might also say that they were hoping that your product could help them move faster maybe they have something
22:09
they were looking to launch in six months and with your product they can actually get it launched in a couple
22:14
weeks that sounds really valuable or they might say that your product could help them avoid risk if you help with
22:20
compliance or offloading something a headache that they don't want to deal with another way to find your value is
22:26
to keep incrementally raising prices until you get pushback from users and when you keep incrementally raising your
22:33
prices you will ultimately find the ideal price which is when customers complain but they still pay
22:41
this is actually a good thing right it overcomes that fear of charging a high
22:46
price and customers walking away because the ideal scenario is when you tell the
22:52
customer a price they say they have to think about it they go back and then they come back to you a week later and
22:58
they say all right that seems good you're the best solution we're willing to pay up on the other side if you were
23:04
to actually charge a lower price and they say yeah that sounds great and accept immediately well that probably
23:09
means that you're pricing too low and you're leaving a lot of money on the table which brings me to my third Insight which is that most startups are
23:17
actually under charging you almost certainly are and lower prices are not a sustainable
23:23
Advantage sometimes we talk to Founders and they say well our product is just
23:28
like our large competitor except ours is cheaper and that actually does not sound like a good idea that's not a way to
23:35
build a winner all that means is that your large competitor can underprice you
23:40
even way lower than your cost because they have way more money and they're way larger than you until they put you out
23:47
of business so I do not recommend having price as your only differentiator it
23:52
also turns out that when you charge more you get higher margins and you're able to build a bigger moat this means if you
23:59
have higher margins than your competitors you can pay more to acquire a customer which means you can acquire
24:05
all of the customers before they do it's also important to remember that pricing implies value when customers are
24:12
evaluating your product they typically don't have a lot of signals on how valuable your product is but the price
24:18
that you're charging is actually one of the primary ones so if your price is lower than your competitors then your
24:25
customers might assume that your product is less valuable than theirs similarly if you charge a higher price then your
24:33
customers might assume that your product is even more valuable than your competitors so that can work really well
24:38
and so it turns out that raising prices is actually the easiest way to grow Revenue if you have a thousand customers
24:45
and you want to double your Revenue well it sounds pretty difficult to spend all the time energy and money to go get a
24:52
thousand more customers however if you're able to just double your price just changing a number on the website or
24:59
changing the price that you're quoting to customers in a sales call and your product supports that higher
25:06
value well you've just doubled your Revenue with almost no work at all but
25:11
what if users won't pay more this usually means one of two things it either means that you need to build more
25:18
value into your product right maybe the price that you have raised it to is now
25:23
higher than the value that your customers see or it could mean that you
25:28
need to solve a bigger problem maybe the problem that you're solving for customers is just a nice to have that
25:35
they would never be willing to spend a lot of money for so in this instance it usually means you want to move to a more
25:42
important top three problem that they have there's a third option too which is you could give a lower price in exchange
25:49
for one of four key things one you could give a lower price in exchange for your first user if you're just looking for
25:55
initial feedback and getting somebody on the platform totally reasonable to give a lower price for that or if you're
26:01
talking to a valuable customer that has a recognizable logo that can be another good scenario where
26:08
you would give a lower price you can then use this logo that you get as social proof to get other customers onto
26:15
your platform at your regular price also if your product builds lock-in Say by
26:21
getting customer data on your platform that they would lose if they leave that can be another reason to offer a lower
26:27
price and if you're able to renew after the first year and bump your customers
26:33
up to that higher price that can be a good reason to get people in at the lower price because you know you can
26:38
capture more value from them further down the road it's also really important to remember that pricing isn't permanent
26:44
this is another common fear that we see from Founders where they're afraid that they have to nail their pricing the
26:51
first time or they're going to lose their customer and never have a chance to get them again or sometimes Founders
26:57
are afraid that the set of customers that they're talking to are the only ones they're ever going to get and so
27:04
they have to close them all and if that's the case you should probably work on a different business but it acts is
27:10
relatively painless to be able to increase prices on customers over time too and there's a couple different ways
27:16
to do this you can exclude existing customers by letting them keep their current pricing and only raising prices
27:24
for all new customers that's one way to do it or you could give advanced notice that you plan to raise prices and as
27:31
long as you build in enough value into your product to cover that price increase you shouldn't see much churn
27:37
most people will probably be willing to pay it if you have a sticky product Netflix is a great example of this this
27:43
chart actually shows price increases that Netflix has made over the last seven or so years and it's really
27:50
interesting to see that they are not shy about raising prices on their customers and now Netflix has 221 million paid
27:57
subscribers and they've been able to figure out how to raise prices because that is the easiest way for them to grow
28:03
Revenue rather than continuing to try to scale subscriber growth at the same rate so if Netflix is a able to find a way to
28:11
increase their prices on 221 million customers you should be able to figure
28:16
out how to do it on your handful of early customers as well and the fifth Insight is to keep it simple this is an
28:22
example of a pricing page for Quicken and as you can see it's very complex there's five different buy buttons
28:29
there's prices there's 349 399 599 899 there's crossed out prices there's one
28:37
dollar off with a symbol right next to it it's really complicated to figure out even if you want to be a Quicken
28:43
customer which plan you should go with and so this likely results in decreased
28:48
conversion rates so it's important to remember that when you're creating your pricing you don't want it to create
28:54
friction that prevents customers from signing up and paying you on the flip side here's a great example from gitlab
29:02
they have three very clear simple plans with clear pricing and so their pricing
29:08
and their pricing page is not going to be the thing that adds more friction and
29:13
prevents customers from signing up and paying them and so I'll leave you with this story of segment which helps
Story of Segment - How to charge for your product
29:19
companies capture and use their customer data when they started out they were a couple of Engineers that were not used
29:26
to paying for products themselves and so they thought they had to give their product away for free in order to get
29:32
anybody to use it and then they wanted to raise money from investors so they decided maybe we should actually charge
29:38
our customers money so we can show Revenue growth so tail between their legs they reached out to all their free
29:45
customers and sheepishly told them that they were actually going to start charging them ten dollars per month
29:51
which was a hundred and twenty dollars per year and so they were really nervous about telling their customers this but
29:57
surprisingly their customers started responding to them with messages like I hope you would charge me more than that
30:03
otherwise I'm worried about keeping my customer data with you right the low price was signaling to their customers
30:10
that maybe their product was invaluable or it couldn't be trusted in the long term and so in order to grow even more
30:17
they hired a sales advisor and that sales advisor told them you should not
30:23
be charging a hundred twenty dollars a year instead you should be charging a hundred twenty thousand dollars per year
30:29
this is an Enterprise product and this scared them to hear this it was
30:35
unfathomable to them that anybody would ever pay a hundred twenty thousand dollars a year for their product and so
30:41
when they were going into of their first sales meeting with their sales advisor the advisor told them if you don't tell
30:48
this customer that your price is a hundred twenty thousand dollars then I quit as your sales advisor so they went
30:55
into the meeting and at the end when it came time to talk price and the customer said so how much is it the CEO got
31:02
really red and he got nervous and he said a hundred twenty thousand dollars
31:08
and the customer responded how about twelve thousand dollars and they ultimately ended up agreeing on eighteen
31:14
thousand dollars as their price so while they didn't actually get the Thousand X price increase
31:21
they were able to increase their price 150 times from 120 dollars a year all
31:28
the way up to eighteen thousand dollars a year and it wouldn't have happened if they didn't ask for the higher price and
31:34
so they used this philosophy to continue growing their deal sizes all the way up
31:40
to six figures and Beyond and ultimately led to their acquisition by twilio for
31:45
more than three billion dollars so the story of segment hopefully is instructive to you that they started out
31:51
giving away their product for free ultimately ended up selling to huge Enterprises and building a business
31:58
worth over three billion dollars so to wrap up the five key pricing insights
Wrap-up - Key pricing insights
32:03
the first is you should charge next is you should price on value not on cost
32:09
the third is most startups are under charging and you probably are too the
32:14
fourth is that pricing isn't permanent don't have fear that you need to get it right the first time you can change it
32:20
over time as you learn more and build more value into your product and finally keep it simple don't add complexity
32:28
which adds friction to customers giving you their money thank you
