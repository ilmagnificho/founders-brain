How To Talk To Users  Startup School

YC often says "talk to your users", but actually doing that is surprisingly tricky. YC Group Partner Gustaf Alströmer gives non-obvious advice on how to talk to both current and potential users, how to run a great user interview, and how to interpret the feedback in these conversations.

0:09
my name is Gustav and I work here at y
0:12
combinator as a group partner I've been
0:14
here since 2017. before YC I was a
0:17
practically to Airbnb and actually a YC
0:20
founder back in 2007. today I'm going to
0:22
talk about how to talk to your users and
0:25
your future customers here's what I plan
Outline
0:27
to cover today why the best Founders
0:29
talk to the users throughout the
0:31
lifetime of the company two how to find
0:33
your users and how to talk to them three
0:35
what questions to ask them and what not
0:37
to ask them and four how to turn your
0:40
conclusions into an MVP most people in
Best founders learn from their users
0:42
the world have the idea on how new
0:44
startups to form completely wrong they
0:46
think ideas of new products is something
0:48
the financials come up with on a lazy
0:49
Sunday or a late night coding session
0:51
you probably know it doesn't work this
0:53
way this scene as you can see here here
0:55
is a scene from The Social Network movie
0:57
it's a great movie but they got a lot of
0:59
things wrong on how Facebook actually
1:01
got started this is Brian chesky Brian
1:03
is the co-founder and CEO of Airbnb on
1:06
the left side of the photo is Amal Amal
1:08
was the very first guest on Airbnb they
1:10
actually spent a weekend together in San
1:12
Francisco when they'd be kind of watched
1:14
you notice the difference between this
1:16
photo and the previous photo well this
1:18
photo actually is a real photo it
1:19
includes a two-way conversation with a
1:21
real customer great Founders talk to
1:23
Future customers before they even have a
1:25
product in fact the very best Founders
1:28
in the world learn directly from their
1:30
users throughout the life of their
1:32
company but that's again if you have
1:34
correctly identified who your users are
1:36
you should learn from them throughout
1:38
the lifetime of your company why you
1:40
might ask
1:41
users and customers will keep you honest
1:44
they are the only stakeholders actually
1:46
paying you anything if anyone will tell
1:49
you the truth it will be them so my talk
1:51
today is about how to do this well so
1:54
let's talk about another m b story in
1:56
2010 um and I remember this uh myself
1:59
Brian chesky the CEO of Airbnb he'll
2:02
decide to launch an experiment he was
2:04
going to give up his apartment and live
2:06
in 50 different airbnbs over the next
2:08
couple of months you might ask yourself
2:09
why would anyone do that so much hassle
2:12
most people read the articles about this
2:14
experiment because he did announce it
2:15
they missed a point
2:17
um I personally remember this being kind
2:19
of crazy by doing this Brian will
2:21
literally get a chance to talk to every
2:22
one of these 50 hosts each single day on
2:25
this trip and one incredible source of
2:27
honest feedback on your product without
2:28
the Airbnb hosts MB would not exist
2:31
exist today what Brian Joe and Nate did
2:33
so early is deeply understand the
2:35
motivations
2:36
um and the feedback from their hosts
2:38
still today Brian and Joe gets calls
2:41
from hosts on their personal cell phone
2:43
numbers I remember them telling me that
2:45
that on their first day of adworks at
2:47
Airbnb
2:48
why do they do that well it's the number
2:50
that they put on the website and share
2:52
with all of their hosts early on they
2:54
weren't hiding behind Anonymous email
2:55
they wanted to hear from the customers
2:57
at the time this seemed almost radical
3:00
most Founders would spend their time in
3:02
front of the computers trying to find
3:04
scalable growth channels like Google ads
3:06
unfortunately most Founders still don't
3:09
build personal connections with their
3:10
users today behind behind info at emails
3:13
or don't do not reply emails you don't
3:17
believe me you should just do a search
3:18
in your email for do not reply at and
3:21
see how many people don't want to talk
Who should I talk to?
3:23
to their customers so let's start by
3:25
trying to figure out who I should talk
3:27
to it's always easy to interview people
3:30
that you know or people who are on your
3:32
network they're simply the most likely
3:33
to respond but perhaps can be less
3:35
honest in their answers to not offend
3:39
you don't be afraid of reaching out to
3:41
them and don't be afraid of rejection
3:43
the second group here is co-workers or
3:45
former co-workers they can be a really
3:47
great source they might know the topic
3:49
really well and if you're building
3:51
software for startups you can easily and
3:53
easily navigate yourself to someone
3:55
who's a potential User it's also very
3:57
common that the early users you speak to
3:59
are outside of your personal circuits or
4:01
your co-workers circles when asking YC
4:03
Founders how they found their early
4:05
users some of the most common answers
4:07
were LinkedIn red forms slack or Discord
4:10
communities and sometimes in-person
4:12
events so to illustrate this process
4:15
um a little better I'm going to start a
4:17
new mock startup this is not a real
4:19
company I'm just making it up but I'm
4:21
going to go through the process as I
4:22
would have if this was a real company
4:24
and first I want to understand if the
4:26
problem is real my hypothesis that I
4:28
have here or kind of like the idea space
4:30
that we sometimes call as NYC is that
4:33
companies want to reduce their carbon
4:35
emissions but for whatever reasons don't
4:36
do that so my plan is very simple I want
4:39
to first interview some potential
4:40
customers to learn about the problems
4:42
and motivations around carbon emissions
4:44
and three try to understand what an MVP
4:46
will look like MVP is a minimal viable
4:48
product to do this research I plan to
4:51
start by reaching out to Founders CEOs
4:53
CFOs at startups or bigger companies I'm
4:57
also going to be shocked to people on
4:58
LinkedIn that have titles like
5:01
carbon or climate or sustainability
5:04
basically Wars that gives me hint that
5:07
they might be relevant people to talk to
5:09
so what am I looking to learn well first
5:11
I'm trying to understand do the company
5:13
that they work for care about their
5:15
carbon emissions and two why do they
5:18
care and why do they not care if they
5:20
don't care and three who in that company
5:23
might be the one who cares the most
5:25
about this uh and why all right so so
5:27
here are two examples of Outreach
5:29
messages so the first one is a LinkedIn
5:31
message to a CFO who I used to work with
5:33
at Airbnb the message will go something
5:35
like this first I introduce myself I
5:37
mentioned something about our time at
5:38
Airbnb then I say I'm starting a new
5:40
project briefly describe it but not too
5:42
much in detail and I just asked for 20
5:44
minute phone call or video call that's
5:46
it and here's another example of a
5:48
message to someone I don't know it's
5:50
also on LinkedIn to the same group that
5:52
I mentioned earlier it's similar but
5:54
geared towards people I don't know so
5:56
the message will and the tone will be a
5:57
little bit different all right so once I
How to interview potential customers
6:00
get on the phone or once again on the
6:02
video call let's talk about uh how to
6:05
actually interview potential customers
6:07
so first you want to make sure that
6:09
these interviews are over video calls
6:11
phone calls or in person you can learn a
6:13
lot more from a five minute video
6:15
interview than 500 or 5 000 sugar
6:18
responses
6:19
secondly you want to build some Report
6:21
with interviewee they're going to give
6:24
you answers to questions that maybe no
6:25
one have asked them before so you need
6:27
to make sure that they can trust you and
6:28
feel comfortable in this situation next
6:30
uh the most important thing here the
6:32
most most important thing here is to not
6:35
introduce your idea until maybe at the
6:37
end of the call or maybe not at all
6:39
doing this too early can bias them in
6:41
their answers your role here in this
6:44
interview is to listen not to talk
6:47
there are some great techniques to get
6:49
people to open up and talk about their
6:51
problems and one good one is to ask
6:53
follow-up questions that are open-ended
6:55
for example tell me about that if you're
6:58
not recording the interview you should
7:00
at least take notes as much as you can
7:03
you need to translate the recordings to
7:05
notes anyway so you might as well take
7:07
notes in the in the actual interview I'm
7:08
going to play an example video here on
7:11
uh how a potential customer for my
7:14
carbon emission company and how that
7:16
conversation will go like Hi how are you
7:18
um it's been a long time since we worked
7:20
together Airbnb
7:21
yeah great to see you
7:23
so I don't know if I told her this but
7:25
I'm thinking about starting another
7:26
company and I have a couple questions I
7:28
wanted to ask you about this era that
7:30
I'm interested in uh does your company
7:32
montevue Inc do you care about your
7:34
carbon emissions
7:36
we do actually care and we use a
7:38
consultant who creates these PDF reports
7:40
once a year
7:41
interesting uh what do you do with a
7:44
report
7:45
I mean right now I don't think we really
7:47
take much action on it unfortunately
7:50
well why not
7:51
it's just really hard to know what to do
7:53
with the information
7:55
um the information is really dense and
7:57
um uses words we don't really understand
8:00
tell me more about that
8:01
well we hired this consultant
8:04
um they asked us to fill out this word
8:06
doc with information but most of the
8:08
data that goes into it uh seems
8:10
inaccurate and I just feel like we need
8:13
another expert to figure out what to do
8:15
with the data
8:16
got it got it
8:18
um but why is it important for your
8:20
company at all to track carbon emission
8:22
well our
8:29
um and I think there's some regulations
8:30
coming up too
8:32
you notice here how I never introduced a
8:35
product or a solution I only ask
8:37
questions to learn about the problem
8:39
that Amy's having I don't even say what
8:41
I'm going to build
8:42
that's how you want to do it here are
8:44
some very specific questions that you
8:46
can use in your interviews one tell me
8:48
how you do X today by X of course I'm
8:51
referring to a specific problem a task
8:53
or goal that you are trying to solve two
8:55
what is the hardest thing you are doing
8:57
about x three why is it hard four how
9:01
often do you have to do x five why is it
9:04
important for your company to do X make
9:06
sure you dive deep into this question
9:07
like understanding that motivation is
9:09
going to be critical here and six what
9:11
do you do to solve this problem for
9:13
yourself today it's really important to
9:15
understand what they're doing
9:18
now if you can watch them do this that's
9:21
even better if they can screen share
9:23
during the video call or show you their
9:25
laptop as you're doing the interview and
9:28
show you how they actually get the PDF
9:30
report what they do with it
9:32
um how it looks like
9:33
that's the ideal State you want to
9:36
deeply understand their behavior not
9:37
just what they're saying but what
9:39
they're doing because changing the
9:41
behavior will be hard you can also ask
Follow ups & Don't ask these questions
9:43
follow-up questions and please learn how
9:45
to make use of these ones it's very hard
9:47
to get someone to say everything in just
9:49
one answer to one question get
9:51
comfortable with asking questions like
9:53
what do you mean by that or can you tell
9:55
me more about that or why is that
9:58
important to you here are some questions
9:59
that you should not ask like there are
10:01
ways you can kind of derail this
10:04
interview will you use our product
10:06
they're probably going to say yes but
10:08
they're not going to mean anything to
10:09
you the answer
10:11
two which features would make product X
10:14
better
10:15
remember their job is to tell you about
10:17
the problem your job is to think about
10:19
what features to solve that problem so
10:22
asking them about your job isn't really
10:24
going to help you yes and no questions
10:27
it's not really that helpful for you you
10:29
want them to explain and give you as
10:32
many concrete and real examples as
10:35
possible so just simply asking yes no
10:36
questions is not ideal here and four
10:39
um how would would a better product X
10:42
look like to you how would a better
10:44
Carbon emission counting software look
10:46
like to you uh many of the people aren't
10:48
product developers they're not software
10:49
Engineers they're not designers they're
10:51
not product managers this is not their
10:53
job their job is to do a different job
10:55
and you are the one trying to understand
10:58
what is the challenging part about their
11:00
job
11:01
and finally
11:03
um asking two questions at the same time
11:05
that's going to confuse them it's going
11:06
to confuse your answers so this is when
11:09
you're eager to get um get answers it's
11:11
very easy to do this this thing but try
11:13
to avoid it but I want to highlight one
11:15
of the things I mentioned here there's
11:16
one big danger during interviews and
11:18
that is to focus on features instead of
11:19
problems
11:20
it's very natural for you to do that
11:22
your bra your brain is thinking through
11:24
all the ways you're going to solve this
11:26
problem
11:27
but really what you're here for during
11:28
this interview is to deeply understand
11:30
the problems not actually come up with
11:32
Solutions that's for for us for a
11:35
separate event so users generally have
11:38
good problems but also generally bad
11:40
Solutions so I'll give you two specific
11:42
examples so early days of Gmail users
11:45
were asking
11:46
um Paul Buchheit the founder of Gmail to
11:49
view both the Inbox and the actual email
11:52
that they were reading on the same
11:53
screen now why would they ask for that
11:55
well the reason was simply that Gmail is
11:57
too slow and people did not want to wait
11:59
to load each of the emails in the inbox
12:01
they want to see everything at the same
12:02
time similarly in early Airbnb a lot of
12:05
guests want to have the phone numbers of
12:07
the host so they can call them we're
12:09
like why do you need that it just turned
12:12
out that they didn't fully trust the
12:13
platform like we had not displayed
12:15
enough trust in Airbnb so they needed to
12:18
feel comfortable uh with getting to know
12:19
the host before it actually
12:21
um making the booking secondly
12:23
um users don't
12:25
have incentive to say no to really any
12:28
additional features if you ask for this
12:29
feature or this feature this feature
12:30
they'll probably say yes to everything
12:32
right you however are in charge of the
12:34
projectations and you have a lot more
12:36
incentives than they have to figure out
12:38
which are the most important of the
12:41
features so let's talk about next steps
12:43
so you've done your um five or ten of
12:45
these user interviews you've written
12:47
down your notes let's let's talk about
12:49
what you do then one you want to make
12:51
sure you have notes from all each of the
12:52
interviews you can use sticky notes or
12:54
some similar software to organize these
12:56
learnings you can bucket them in
12:58
different buckets that kind of describes
13:00
different problems and see which one is
13:01
actually the thing that matters the most
13:03
and then you want to write down your
13:04
conclusions what are you learning from
13:06
all of this you want to use all of this
13:08
information to create a hypothesis or
13:10
what the solution to this problem might
13:11
be don't over intellectualize this
13:13
process really you just want to start
13:14
assigning MVP as fast as you can but you
13:16
want to make sure you have accurate
13:17
information when you decide the MEP and
13:20
then you'll want to test it with the
13:21
same users it's also important to know
13:22
if the problem you're solving is
13:24
actually valuable what I mean by this is
13:26
that people will value the solution to
13:29
the problem enough to pay for it or the
13:31
problem itself solving the problem is
13:33
valuable so here's some good tips to
13:35
determine if it is one are people paying
13:37
money for other Solutions in the space
13:39
today are the people that make the PDF
13:41
reports for carbon emissions accounting
13:42
are they getting paid well if they are
13:44
getting paid that's a good sign that
13:45
this is probably a valuable thing do
13:47
people already have solutions to this
13:48
problem they are very happy with even
13:50
though it might appear Basics to you for
13:52
example like Excel or Google
13:54
spreadsheets is actually competitors to
13:56
many many many hundreds of startups
13:58
actually quite a formidable one to move
13:59
someone off Excel a Google spreadsheet
14:01
you need to make the experience of your
14:03
solution dramatically better they're not
14:05
going to pay you hundreds of dollars a
14:06
month for something they can almost as
14:08
easily do in Google spreadsheet or Excel
14:10
and three you want to evaluate how easy
14:12
it is to sell to this audience and this
14:14
is one thing that I like to do a lot
14:16
with the companies I work with for
14:17
example selling to Plumbers or
14:19
contractors is notoriously difficult
14:21
compared to selling to startups the
14:22
first two groups just don't change their
14:24
tools or the software very often versus
14:27
startups are open to trying new things
14:29
all the time so if you are solving a
14:32
problem is valuable you still have to
14:33
think about whether it's going to be
14:35
easy to sell this particular audience
14:36
once you have an MVP prototype you can
MVP prototype session interviews
14:39
start by showing it to users even if
14:41
it's just a design prototype in Envision
14:43
or something like that you can just
14:44
click through we used to do this at MB
14:46
all the time we would go downstairs in
14:48
our in our office and we would find some
14:50
people that were waiting for an
14:52
interview or waiting for getting a
14:54
coffee or something and we just show
14:55
them the latest version of the app this
14:57
would be a Envision prototype on our
14:59
phone it would be Spike hand them our
15:01
phone and and show it to them this is
15:03
stuff that we haven't even built yet the
15:05
key thing but if you're doing this
15:06
tactic is to not tell them what to do do
15:11
not tell them what to do just watch them
15:12
play around with it you can tell them a
15:14
specific goal like try to make a book in
15:16
Airbnb or try to do a search with dates
15:19
and even b or something like that but do
15:21
not tell them exactly how to solve each
15:23
screen remember if this was a real
15:25
product you wouldn't you wouldn't be
15:26
standing there next to them to give them
15:27
advice another good trick when you're
15:29
doing this either when you're listening
15:31
or having them or recording them is to
15:34
have them speak their mind while they're
15:35
doing it have them describe exactly what
15:37
they're thinking on each of the steps
15:39
maybe the words that they're reading
15:41
maybe that will give you hints of what
15:42
words that they understand and which
15:44
words they don't understand or maybe
15:45
what specific screen means or what
15:47
purpose is and after you've done a bunch
15:49
of these interviews and then maybe MVP
15:52
protest sessions it's a great idea to
15:54
keep these interviewees involved
15:56
throughout the process
15:57
one common idea that a lot of wasting
15:59
companies are using is to create a slack
16:01
instance or a WhatsApp group for with
16:03
their customers now you want to make
16:05
them feel special right you want to make
16:07
them feel like they have exclusive
16:08
active access to the Future world
16:11
changing product so think about how
16:13
you're wording or or how you communicate
16:16
this WhatsApp group that you adding them
16:18
to it's a great idea to keep showing
16:19
them your product as they are
16:21
progressing like kind of give them this
16:23
exclusive feeling that I'm the first one
16:24
to see this product assets progressing
16:27
and also as you are
16:30
reacting to things that they're saying
16:32
you can ship a new a new screen with a
16:34
new version of the product
16:36
um and that builds trust with it with
16:38
them they now know that you react to
16:40
their feedback very fast finally some of
16:42
them will love connecting with other
16:44
people doing the same thing as they are
16:46
they don't get to do this very often and
16:49
um you are the one enabling that if you
16:51
do all these steps you will collect the
16:53
right information
16:54
um from your future users you will keep
16:56
them involved and transfer the
16:59
information uh and that allow you to
17:01
transfer the information into your first
17:02
prototype and MVP so to summarize here's
Summary
17:05
what I covered today why the best
17:07
Founders talk to their users throughout
17:08
the lifetime of the company
17:10
how to find your users and how to talk
17:12
to them
17:13
what questions to ask them and what not
17:15
to ask them and finally how to turn some
17:17
of those conclusions into an MVP thank
17:20
you everyone
