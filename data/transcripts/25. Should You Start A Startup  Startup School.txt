I'm Hodge tiger one of the group Partners at y  combinator today I'm going to talk about whether  
0:14
you should start a startup because YC invests  in startups so early I've spent a lot of time  
0:19
with people who aren't yet sure if they should  start a company or not I've helped many people  
0:23
including my own friends and family think about  this decision at my intended audience for this  
0:27
talk is anyone who doesn't feel ready to start  a startup today but thinks they may want to one  
0:32
day in the future I'm going to break down the  topic of whether you should start a startup into  
0:36
two parts first we'll talk about which types of  people seem best suited to being startup Founders  
0:41
and help you figure out if you might be one of  them second we'll talk about how you might best  
0:45
prepare yourself for becoming a startup founder  in the future let's start by helping you figure  
How to decide whether to be a startup founder.
0:50
out if you're the kind of person who should become  a startup founder or not I really wish there were  
0:54
simple test you could take that would give you a  clear and correct answer to that question I've now  
0:58
worked with almost a thousand startup Founders as  a group partner at YC and I still get surprised by  
1:03
which people take to Startup life like a duck  to water and which ones struggle to adapt now  
1:07
you might find this surprising if your image of  startups is based on the way famous Founders are  
1:12
often depicted in books or movies these depictions  can make it seem that if you're not a ruthless  
1:16
brilliant programmer like Mark Zuckerberg in The  Social Network movie or a charismatic product  
1:21
genius like Steve Jobs in one of the many books or  movies about him you probably aren't cut out to be  
1:26
a startup founder now I can't deny it that being  a brilliant programmer or a charismatic product  
1:32
genius will certainly make it easier to be a  successful startup founder but I can say that  
1:37
after working with many successful Founders  there are many more different types of people  
1:42
who succeed as startups with different strengths  than just those stereotypes as an investor my job  
1:48
is to pick which people will make great startup  Founders and yet even after 15 years of starting  
1:53
and investing in startups I still get surprised  by who turns out to be a great startup founder  
1:58
that means it's going to be hard for you to know  for sure if you're suited to being one you might  
2:02
think you could just look at how well someone has  done in school or at work and assume success there  
2:07
will lead to success of startups that's definitely  what I thought when I first started working at YC  
2:11
in 2010 and began reading YC funding applications  for the first time after I started working with  
2:16
more startups though I realized that these signals  mattered much less than I'd expected they would  
2:20
when you're working on a startup you have to  put in Blood Sweat and Tears to convince even a  
2:25
single user to care about trying your product let  alone convincing the first 10 or 100 you have to  
2:30
push through a lot of rejection to get there and  because this is your startup all of that rejection  
2:35
feels very personal in a way it doesn't when  you're working at a Fan Company building a product  
2:40
for someone else it takes a lot of resilience  to make it through this initial struggle to get  
Resilience is the most important quality
2:45
your early users and that's the quality I think  is most important for startup Founders to have  
2:51
resilient people are suited to startups and should  definitely become Founders but how do you know if  
2:56
you have enough resilience to be a startup founder  when I first started working at yce I thought I  
3:01
could use confidence as a proxy for resilience I'd  assume that if someone projected confidence like  
3:06
speaking with conviction being high energy during  our funding interviews they were likely to be a  
3:11
resilient founder the more Founders I worked with  though the more I realized this was also wrong  
3:18
it turned out that someone could appear very  confident initially but not be resilient when  
3:23
their startup hit roadblocks conversely some of  the quietest and least confident seeming Founders  
3:28
at first turned out to be the most resilient  Founders I'd go on to work with many eventually  
3:33
taking their companies public this is Saji the  founder of benchlink I met him when we funded  
Founder of Benchling (S12)
3:39
benjling in 2012. benjling is now worth over  six billion dollars and Sagi has grown into  
3:45
a formidable founder and CEO but I remember when  we first interviewed him and his co-founder Corey  
3:51
they were both softly spoken engineers and we  were all concerned they wouldn't be suited to  
3:56
working on benchling because benchling's idea  was to sell software to biotech companies and  
4:02
pharmaceutical companies to make money and we  weren't sure that they would be good at that  
4:08
kind of Enterprise sales this concern was  shared by investors at demoday who worried  
4:13
that they wouldn't be able to get those biotech or  pharmaceutical companies to pay for the benchling  
4:18
software and benjling struggled to raise very  much seed funding at demoday sales did turn out  
4:24
to be a real struggle for benchlink in fact over a  year after they'd graduated from YC benchling was  
4:31
still not making any Revenue though they did  have some enthusiastic grad students as free  
4:35
users and the product continued getting better  it took them almost another year that's now two  
4:41
years after ycee to start doing sales and making  any Revenue now benchling is on calls to become  
4:48
a public company someday and has many of the  world's top biotech and pharmaceutical companies  
4:52
as customers looking back I always had confidence  that Sagi was a good engineer but I could not have  
4:59
predicted back when we funded him in 2012 that he  would have the resilience to overcome that amount  
5:05
of rejection and transform himself into the leader  of a company that took many years to become great  
5:10
at Enterprise sales but what I haven't shared  with you are the stories of many other Founders  
Startup resilience - Initial motivation isn't important
5:15
who seemed equally talented at first when we  first funded their companies but turned out  
5:20
not to have the same amount of resilience as these  Founders did I've thought a lot about how to tell  
5:24
the difference between people who have this kind  of startup resilience and those who don't I've  
5:29
wondered if maybe having the right motivations or  reasons to start a company mean you're more likely  
5:34
to have this special resilience over time though  I've decided that this also doesn't matter as much  
5:40
as I had thought I think there are many perfectly  legitimate motivations to start a company for  
5:46
example it's become popular to say that you  shouldn't start a company just to make money  
5:51
that's considered a somewhat flimsy motivation but  I actually think it's fine to start a startup to  
5:55
become rich startups are one of the few ways  to make life-changing amounts of money in a  
6:00
relatively short period of time if the desire to  make money gets you started then great go for it  
6:05
I also think that simply being curious about  what it's like to found a startup is a fine  
6:11
initial motivation to start one actually doing  a startup is the only way to know for sure if  
6:17
you'll enjoy it the reason I have conviction  that your initial motivations don't matter so  
6:21
much is that I've seen motivation to change over  time I've seen Founders who started out a company  
6:26
with a plan to sell it within a year change  their mind as they kept working the company  
6:32
and they're still working on that same startup  a decade later and it's now a public company  
6:37
this means that your initial motivations to  start a startup aren't as important as what  
6:43
those motivations might change into over time in  order to keep working on a startup and keep going  
6:50
through those dark periods that every startup  experience is you need enduring motivations  
6:55
and I think the best ones are to be genuinely  interested in the problem you're working on and  
7:00
love the people you're working with we'll talk  more about finding those later so instead of  
As a curious founder ask "What do I have to lose"?
7:05
introspecting too much on if you'll make a good  startup founder I'll offer some practical advice  
7:11
if you are curious about what it'd be like to  start a company start by asking yourself what  
7:16
do I have to lose now I mean this question not  as a rhetorical one but as a very practical one  
7:22
figure out what the worst case scenario looks  like if you started a startup and decide if  
7:27
you can live with that it's probably going to  take at least a year for you to have enough  
7:31
data to tell if the startup you're working  on is promising enough to keep working on  
7:36
in the worst case you'll shut down the company  without having earned much or any salary for  
7:42
that year can you live without worst case  the calculus here is different for everyone  
7:48
if you're about to graduate college taking a year  after graduating to work on a startup is not a big  
7:54
deal those job offers will still be waiting for  you in a year but if you've been a Fang employee  
8:00
for the past nine years and you're in line for a  big promotion this year then maybe you stand to  
8:05
lose a lot by spending the next year working on a  startup instead asking yourself if you can handle  
8:10
the worst case is the best way to know if you  should start a startup be honest with yourself if  
8:15
you can't actually handle the worst case then your  own constant anxiety will probably self-sabotage  
8:21
your startup efforts when you're thinking about  the worst case scenario of working on a startup  
8:25
you should Factor something else into the equation  you will learn a lot from starting a company I  
8:31
don't think enough people factor in how valuable  this learning is when they're doing their worst  
8:34
case scenario analysis as a startup founder you're  responsible for making everything happen and that  
8:40
means you get to do lots of different types  of work you'll have to do some amount of sales  
8:44
product and customer support all at once this can  be very clarifying in helping you figure out what  
8:50
type of work you enjoy and where you might want to  focus your career even if the startup doesn't work  
8:55
out some people start a company that doesn't work  and then they jump straight back into starting  
8:59
another one because they want to learn from their  mistakes others decide they actually really enjoy  
9:04
specializing in doing one thing really well and  they join a company where they can do just that  
9:09
the startup experience can really improve your  career opportunities even if the startup doesn't  
Startup experience can improve your career opportunities
9:14
succeed my second startup triple bite use software  to help companies identify and hire great people  
9:21
I work with hundreds of employers as they search  for the best talent and I found that many of them  
9:26
were explicitly looking to hire people who  had previous startup experience they believe  
9:30
they showed evidence of being a self-starter and  being able to take initiative and Lead projects  
9:35
some of the most successful YC companies have  actually built their hiring processes around this  
9:40
knowledge Rippling a 10 billion dollar company  founded by Parker Conrad also a YC company hires  
9:46
former Founders and puts them in charge of entire  product divisions usually we love hiring former  
9:51
Founders to run specific product lines and and  build them and and really run them as general  
9:56
managers we've been you know really successful at  recruiting I think we have Lao now probably around  
10:02
50 former Founders that work at rip Lane at YC  we often see startup Founders leave this thought  
10:08
up if it doesn't work out and go on to join a  more successful YC company this is Nick Grandy  
10:14
YC funded his first startup wonderbar in 2008.  that startup shut down but he went on to join  
10:21
another YC company you may have heard of Airbnb  as his first employee that of course worked out  
10:27
great and after many years at Airbnb he left  to start another YC company out school which  
10:32
is now valued at over 3 billion I share these  stories to show how career progressions are  
10:38
not always perfectly linear introducing some  Serendipity and meeting smart ambitious people  
10:44
can completely transform your career and being  a startup founder is a great way to do exactly  
10:49
that okay so let's say you do decide you can  live with the worst case of doing a startup but  
Getting ready to start a startup in the future
10:55
you're not ready to do one right now how can you  best prepare yourself to start one in the future  
11:00
to actually start a company you'll want two things  an idea and a co-founder now sometimes an idea and  
11:06
co-founder both come to you quickly and you're Off  to the Races there's lots of great startup content  
11:11
out there about how to start a company once you're  ready but let's talk about what to do if it will  
11:16
take you some time to get to that point I'd start  by encouraging you to not think of finding ideas  
11:22
and co-founders as two separate tasks it's hard  to think up good ideas yourself also your ideas  
11:29
will start out being vague and fuzzy more like  a hunch or an Impulse than a clearly formed idea  
11:34
and you'll go through seven iterations of fleshing  it out into something more tangible and concrete  
11:40
having someone to talk through that initial  idea or impulse with and debate and discuss  
11:45
is important and the best person to do that with  is your co-founder I find my best ideas come to  
11:51
me during conversations with smart people so I'd  start by thinking about who do you know that you  
11:56
enjoy talking about ideas with in college these  are often the people you'll go to when you're  
12:01
stuck on a hard problem or they are the people  you most enjoy working on group assignments with  
12:05
at work these are the colleagues who you find  make you the most productive and help you do  
12:10
your best work I'd see these people out and start  having conversations with them about ideas or  
12:15
technologies that you find interesting talk about  products you use every day that you admire or are  
12:20
frustrated by talk about Technologies  you think are underrated today and why  
12:24
flesh your thoughts out and debate them spend  the time between these conversations doing your  
12:29
own reading and research to learn more about the  topics you find interesting if you're a curious  
12:34
person this will seem natural to you anyway all  of this primes your mind to more easily notice  
12:38
and think of potential startup ideas and it helps  you get to know your friends or colleagues better  
12:43
as potential co-founders if you're struggling to  think of people you enjoy talking about ideas with  
12:48
then you probably need to change your environment  and meet some new people if you really want to  
Best environment is working at a startup
12:53
start a company one day it's best to choose an  environment where you will be around many people  
12:58
who might someday be your co-founder I think the  best environment for this is working at a startup  
13:03
you both get to see how a startup works from  the inside and your colleagues will be less  
13:08
risk-averse than the average Fang employee so  if you're in college I'd recommend finding a  
13:13
startup to work at after graduation or if you had  a fan company now think about leaving to join a  
13:18
startup as an intermediate step to starting your  own someday once you're around smart people who  
13:23
you enjoy talking about ideas with I'd recommend  you start experimenting with turning these ideas  
13:28
into side projects at some point during these  conversations you'll eventually say something  
13:33
like huh like it'd be cool if someone built X and  that's the moment to stop and think about how you  
13:39
could be the one to build X is there a simple  first version you could build over a weekend or  
13:44
can you find other people who might be users and  Pitch them on the idea to see how they react keep  
13:49
pulling on this thread until you've come up with a  plan to turn this idea into something real however  
13:54
small it is right now you're not trying to launch  the next unicorn you're just getting used to the  
13:59
experience of turning ideas into reality and  experiencing the thrill of launching something  
14:05
turn your idea into something real you'll  need the skills to actually build them  
14:09
if you're not a programmer then either you need  to learn how to program or find a co-founder who  
14:15
is a programmer my advice speaking from experience  is someone who started his first startup without  
14:21
being able to code you start learning to code you  only need to learn enough to build a version one  
14:27
of your ideas once you're around smart people  and you're working on some side projects  
When to take the leap and start a company?
14:31
how do you know when it's time to take the leap  and quit your job to start a company while it'd  
14:35
be great if one of your side projects started  getting explosive traction and made the decision  
14:39
easy for you you can't rely on that happening if  you're serious about starting a company someday  
14:45
even if you launch your side projects and get some  early users the feedback you get will be mixed  
14:50
it's not uncommon for the early use of any product  to span the spectrum of being delighted appalled  
14:56
and indifferent towards a product to judge how  promising your side project is as a startup idea  
15:01
I'd use some advice from my y combinator partner  Paul bukhai he says that it is better to make a  
15:08
product that a few people really love than one a  lot of people are indifferent Awards if your side  
15:13
project elicits a deep reaction from someone the  kind where they can legitimately say that doing  
15:19
something very differently as a result of your  product existing then you may be onto something a  
15:24
single passionate user of a crude prototype that  was hacked together in a weekend means so much  
15:30
more than a million sign-ups on a waitlist for  something that doesn't exist yet my main advice to  
15:34
you would be to think less about how well your  side projects are going and think more about  
15:39
how much you enjoying the process of thinking up  ideas and turning them into something real are you  
15:44
learning new things and finding yourself energized  contrast this feeling with your day job if you  
15:50
find your job is draining but you have energy  to work on your side projects on evenings and  
15:53
weekends that's a sign it may be time to quit and  work on your own ideas pay particular attention to  
15:59
how much you enjoy working with your side project  collaborators if you enjoy working with them and  
16:04
you both want to be startup Founders recognize how  rare that is having a great co-founder who wants  
16:10
to do a startup is a fantastic reason to quit and  start one to finish my advice is one don't worry  
Advice
16:18
too much about your initial motivations or reasons  to start a company those can change over time  
16:25
simply being curious about the experience  of starting a startup is enough to get going  
16:31
think about the worst case scenario if you did  start a company and be sure you can live with that  
16:36
if you don't yet have an idea or co-founder start  looking around for smart people to talk about  
16:41
ideas with and launch some side projects  with actually launch those side projects  
16:47
however small to get the experience of turning  ideas into reality and if you find someone you  
16:53
really enjoy working with side projects with and  you both want to start a company make the jump  
16:59
I really hope you do and I hope we get to work  together at YC Community someday thanks so much
